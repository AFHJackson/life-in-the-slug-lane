# Prologue: The Ride That Shouldn't Have Worked

By the time the green Acura pulled up beside me, I had already resigned myself to the slow way home.

It was late enough that the evening light had given up and the office towers in Crystal City were doing most of the work. The wind coming down from the river had that particular D.C. talent for finding the gap between your collar and your neck. I was walking along the north edge of Crystal City toward the Pentagon bus stop, chewing on the mildly bitter taste of a missed ride home and an overlong workday.

The HOV lanes on I-395 had just opened up to everyone. That magical window for commuters in northern Virginia where three people in a vehicle can magically transport you past the endless lines of traffic headed south was over. It was past the witching hour.

The rules are simple: three people in the car gets you into the fast lane. After it, the gates swing open and anyone can dive in. Before, drivers cruise the commuter lots and bus stops hunting for extra passengers. After, there's no reason to bother.

I had dawdled at the office, rushed down, found the lines at 23rd empty. Walked north toward 12th street lines. Also empty. The slug lines had naturally dried up. I pointed myself toward the Pentagon bus stop and prepared for the long way home.

That's when the Acura eased over, window down.

"You know it's past the witching hour," the driver called out.

He said it like we were co-conspirators in some small, shared secret. It wasn't quite a question, not quite a warning. It was more like a diagnosis: you're out here late, and you know what that means.

I knew exactly what he meant. Once the HOV lanes open to general traffic, the incentives change. No one needs extra passengers. No more reason to pick up strangers.

"I'm headed to the Pentagon for the bus," I said, pointing down the street as if he couldn't see the massive five-sided building glowing a short distance away.

He shrugged. "Don't worry about it," he said. "Jump in. I can get you to Tackett's Mill."

In that moment I did the quick calculus every slug in northern Virginia does dozens of times a year. The math is not written on any sign, but you learn it by heart: risk, reward, vibe check.

Was he sober? Did he sound sane? Did the car look roughly as if it had passed a recent inspection and had not been used for anything an FBI agent might ask about later?

At that hour there were no five-star ratings on a phone screen, no app making soft chimes of reassurance. It was just two humans eyeing each other across a small gulf of uncertainty.

The car looked fine. The driver sounded normal. I pulled the door handle and got in.

Sitting in the passenger seat that night, sliding past the red glow of slower lanes, I found my attention drifting away from small talk and toward that driver's decision.

He had picked me up after the witching hour.

He had already gotten what the policy promised him: unrestricted access to the fast lane. I was now, in purely instrumental terms, unnecessary cargo. Yet he still rolled down his window and invited me in.

For him, with the restriction lifted, there was no special advantage left in having me in the passenger seat. Which is what made his offer so strange.

From a certain kind of economics, the kind we distill into neat diagrams and multiple-choice questions, what he was doing didn't make much sense. He was paying for gas. Adding a full-grown adult to the vehicle meant more weight, more fuel burned, more wear and tear on the car. I was not reimbursing him. There was no cash exchanged, no formal carpool, no government voucher to be redeemed.

He was paying in time, too. Socially, there was no point system, no punch card, no cosmic ledger where he could log this as a credit against future favors. We were strangers. The odds that we would recognize each other in a grocery store a year later were close to zero.

On paper, the whole move was irrational.

Why? Maybe he just wanted the company. Maybe he was in the habit and didn't think much about it. Maybe he remembered what it felt like to be the guy stuck at the bus stop.

The truth is, I don't know his reasons. What I do know is that his simple, slightly irrational act forced a crack in the way I had been taught to think about social and economic systems.

If you don't live in the orbit of the Pentagon, "slugging" sounds like something involving either baseball or garden pests. In reality, it's a form of guerrilla carpooling.

When the high-occupancy vehicle lanes were first opened on I-95 and I-395, they came with a rule: three people in the car and you get to fly past the parking lot on the other side of the barrier. Drivers who faced an hour-plus commute began looking for ways to find those extra warm bodies.

Where do you find people who are definitely headed to the same place every morning? At the bus stop.

Drivers started pulling over near commuter lots and Pentagon-bound stops, rolling down windows, and asking the most trustworthy-looking people in Washington, D.C., which, if we're being honest, usually meant uniformed service members. "You going to the Pentagon?"

If the answer was yes, everyone won. The driver got to qualify for the HOV lane. The passengers got a quieter, faster ride instead of a crowded bus.

This wasn't organized by a task force. There was no charter, no budget line, no branding campaign. It just happened, the way certain simple rules interacting with human ingenuity almost inevitably produce something new.

Bus drivers started pulling up to their stops and finding their passengers missing. People were still at the stop, but not where the buses were supposed to pull in. Instead, they clustered a bit further down, near the spot where private cars would peel off the main road to scoop up riders. These people looked like bus passengers. They had been waiting like bus passengers. But when the official bus opened its doors, they waved off the driver.

They weren't "real" passengers anymore. They were something else.

Driver slang for non-paying riders is "slugs," from fake coins or tokens that trick vending machines and toll booths. The label stuck. Those improvised carpoolers, willing to wait for a faster free ride instead of a slower paid one, became slugs.

A complete stranger could walk up to a slug line for the first time, watch for five minutes, and figure out what to do. Later, signs, websites, and forums emerged to facilitate this adjacent ecosystem, but not initially. The pieces were there. Human phenomena put them to use.

There are no uniforms, no official badges, no ticket machines. There is no central dispatcher, no posted schedule. If a line gets too long and drivers for that destination are scarce, people quietly adjust their plans: they join a different line, arrange a different route, or text someone about a delay.

The whole thing looks, from a distance, remarkably like a formal transportation system. It moves thousands of people each day. It has norms, expectations, and feedback loops. It can respond to changes in traffic, policy, and demand.

But there is no "slug line authority." No one is in charge.

Here is what makes the slug line so hard to categorize.

Is slugging capitalist?

No one is forced to participate. Everyone is pursuing their own self-interest: a faster commute, a cheaper trip, a more predictable schedule. There is private property, voluntary exchange, and a kind of informal marketplace of rides.

Is slugging socialist?

It emerges from a backbone of shared public investment. The highways, ramps, and lots are financed collectively. The HOV incentive is a policy decision: a deliberate choice to trade lane space for fewer cars and faster trips for high-occupancy vehicles.

Is slugging anarchic?

There is no boss, no central committee, no formal enforcement. People queue and ride based on a web of customs and habits they could, in theory, ignore without fear of written penalty. Yet by and large, they don't.

Is slugging communitarian, tribal, charitable?

Strangers often go out of their way to help. Riders share tips and unwritten rules. Drivers will sometimes take small detours to drop someone closer to home. There is a quiet ethic of looking out for one another during snowstorms, emergencies, or breakdowns.

If you are very committed to one ideology, you can squint hard and claim slugging as a victory for your team. But the truth is less satisfying to partisans and more interesting to everyone else.

Slugging is not any one of these things. It is all of them at once.

The ride worked because the state paved highways, public safety officers existed, and written HOV rules were enforced. It worked because car manufacturers competed to build vehicles, people bought them in a market, and employed them to suit individual goals and values. It worked because strangers trusted one another enough to get in and drive together. It worked because informal norms emerged and were honored.

Nobody organized this. And it works every single day.

It is public and private, selfish and generous, structured and improvised. It relies on the state to set broad conditions, on markets to make cars available and gas worth saving, on social trust to make stepping into a stranger's sedan feel normal, and on emergent order to keep thousands of daily interactions from dissolving into chaos.

In other words, it is a system of systems.

No single ideology could claim it. No single system could have produced it alone. Each ideology sees something true: the voluntarism of markets, the public infrastructure of collective investment, the self-organization that emerges when no one is in charge, the neighborly care of people looking out for one another.

The trouble starts when any one of them insists on being the answer to everything.

Like most of us, I had absorbed a mental map in which capitalism, socialism, communism, and anarchy were rival teams on a straight line that ran from "Left" to "Right." Each team came with a starter pack of heroes and villains, historical examples to celebrate or condemn, and standard talking points.

On that map, the first duty of a responsible grown-up was to pick a side.

If you saw the creative power of markets, you were expected to flinch at the word "socialism." If you were moved by solidarity and shared sacrifice, you were supposed to distrust "capitalism." The rugged individualist was suspicious of the state; the nervous citizen suspicious of "anarchy."

You are supposed to choose one as the answer to the question, "How should we live together?"

Yet here I was, in a car that only existed because all of those systems were entangled.

That evening, sliding down I-395 in a stranger's green Acura, a different question began to take shape.

What I do know is that his simple, slightly irrational act forced a crack in the way I had been taught to think about social and economic systems.

Like most of us, I had absorbed a mental map in which these systems were rival teams fighting for dominance. But the slug line wouldn't fit on my map. It refused to sit still. It was all of them working together.

Maybe the problem isn't which ideology is correct.

Maybe the problem is the line itself.

What if we've been arguing about which system should rule, when the real question is: at what scale does each system belong?

We carry around unspoken knowledge about the different scales of human life. A family of five, a neighborhood of five hundred, a city of five hundred thousand, and a nation of three hundred million are not just the same thing with more people. They are different kinds of creatures.

What if capitalism, socialism, and the rest are not mortal enemies fighting for dominance, but different tools designed for different sizes of human life?

A hammer is the right tool for a nail. But that doesn't mean every problem is a nail.

Is it possible that many of the systems we treat as mortal enemies are each appropriate at specific scales of human life? They are not competitors in a winner-take-all tournament. They are different tools for different jobs.

The ride that shouldn't have worked, the driver who picked me up after the witching hour, in a car made by a private company, on a public road, in a self-organized queue of strangers, was my first clear glimpse of that question.

If that's true, then we don't need to pick a winner. We need a better map.

The central question becomes not "Which system should win?" but "At what scale does each system belong, and how do we help them work together instead of tearing each other apart?"

---

This book is an attempt to draw that map.

To follow it, we're going to have to do two things.

First, we'll have to look carefully at the different scales of human life you move through every day, from family to friendships to markets to states, and notice how your instincts change as you cross those boundaries.

Second, we'll have to ask how we ended up with a political and economic map that mostly ignores those scales.

The next chapter begins at a different table, with a four-year-old, a stack of performance charts, and a very bad idea about how to run a family.
