# Archived G+T Draft Files

**Archived:** January 19, 2026  
**Reason:** Superseded by Decision D008 (I→D→G Voice Architecture Pivot)

## Contents

These draft chapters were generated using the original **Galvanizing + Tenacity (G+T)** voice architecture:

- `00-prologue-OPUS.md` - Prologue draft by Opus
- `00-prologue-SONNET.md` - Prologue draft by Sonnet
- `01-one-size-fits-none-OPUS.md` - Chapter 1 draft by Opus
- `01-one-size-fits-none-SONNET.md` - Chapter 1 draft by Sonnet
- `02-broken-line-OPUS.md` - Chapter 2 draft by Opus
- `02-broken-line-SONNET.md` - Chapter 2 draft by Sonnet

## Why Archived

The G+T approach prescribed action steps ("You should...") that fall outside Joshua's Working Genius domains of Invention and Discernment. The new I→D→G voice architecture:

- **Invention Opening (10-15%):** Pattern recognition, counterintuitive framing
- **Discernment Middle (60-70%):** Diagnostic questions, verification invitations
- **Galvanizing Close (15-25%):** Recognition language, not prescriptive steps

These files are preserved for reference but should not be used as templates for new content generation.
