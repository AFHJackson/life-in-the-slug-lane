# CHAPTER 9: Obligation to Excess

## Section 1: Malia the Baker

Malia was at the ovens by 4 AM, the way she'd been for thirty years.

Not because she had to be anymore. She had managers now. Four corner bakeries across Hilo, each with its own morning crew, each capable of running without her. But there was something about the quiet of the predawn kitchen, the smell of rising dough, the rhythm of her hands shaping loaves that she couldn't give up. Didn't want to.

This was where she was best.

She could make eight loaves when she started. Good loaves—her tutu had taught her well—but eight was eight. That was a day's work back then, selling at the farmer's market on Saturdays, barely covering the flour and the booth fee. Every loaf sold. Every dollar counted. That was necessities. That was survival.

Now she could make a hundred before most people woke up. And they were better. Lighter. More consistent. She'd refined the hydration ratios, adjusted the fermentation times, learned which local flours worked best in Hilo's humidity. Thirty years of small improvements, thousands of loaves, the kind of mastery that only comes from showing up every single day and paying attention.

The first bakery had been terrifying. A storefront on Kilauea Avenue, a loan she wasn't sure she could repay, hours that made 4 AM seem like sleeping in. But people came. And they came back. And eventually there were lines. That's when surplus started appearing—money left over after rent, after ingredients, after payroll. Money she could save. Money she could reinvest. A buffer against bad months.

The second bakery made sense. The third felt ambitious. The fourth? The fourth was when Malia realized something had shifted.

She wasn't just covering her necessities anymore. The business was profitable. Her employees had health insurance, paid time off, wages that meant something in Hilo's economy. The buildings were paid for. She had savings. The bakeries could run without her constant attention.

She had surplus. Real surplus. And the surplus had turned into security.

And then she kept getting better.

That's when the excess started showing up.

**By 6 AM, the morning bakes were done.** Malia walked through the cooling racks, doing her count. Breads for the four storefronts. Special orders for the hotels. The standing order for Café Pesto. Pre-sliced loaves for the grocery store.

And then the excess.

Forty loaves that wouldn't sell. Not because they weren't good—they were perfect—but because the market in Hilo could only absorb so much. She could make more than the town could buy. That was the strange gift of mastery: the ability to produce beyond demand.

She used to try to sell it all. Push harder. Find new customers. But that just meant competing with herself, driving prices down, making the business less sustainable. The market had a ceiling. Her capacity didn't.

So the excess went elsewhere.

"Morning, Aunty." Koa, one of her drivers, was already loading the van. He knew the routine. Everything that wouldn't sell today—the beautiful excess—went to three shelters across town. Fresh bread for dinner. Malasadas for breakfast. Pastries that would make the evening meal feel less institutional, more human.

"Shelters first," Malia said. "Then swing by the high school if there's time. I'm teaching that class at two."

Koa grinned. "Those kids are lucky. My baking class in high school was how to burn frozen pizza."

She'd been teaching the intro to baking course at Hilo High for five years now. Fridays, two hours, teaching teenagers the basics her tutu had taught her. Most of them would never bake professionally. That wasn't the point. The point was passing on what she knew because she could. Because she had the time now. Because mastery without teaching felt incomplete.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Tyler at Hilo Homemade Ice Cream.

*Hey Malia - we're ready to try batch #4 if you are. Think we're getting close.*

She smiled. Tyler and his wife Jen had opened their ice cream shop eight months ago. Young family, big dreams, tight budget. They had this idea for an ice cream sandwich—local flavors, artisan cookie, something unique to Hilo. But they couldn't get the cookie right. Too soft, too hard, wrong texture with the ice cream.

Tyler had come to her after their third failed attempt. Could she help? Would she collaborate?

Malia had spent six weekends working on cookie recipes. No charge. No contract. Just the joy of solving a problem that wasn't hers, helping a young business find its feet. If the ice cream sandwich worked, Tyler and Jen would have their signature product. If it didn't, well, they'd all have learned something.

*I'll be there at 10,* she texted back. *Bringing batch 4B - different ratio.*

The collaboration wasn't charity. It was what excess enabled. She had capacity beyond what her business needed. She could experiment, explore, help other people discover what might work. That was the other obligation of excess: not just generosity, but discovery.

**By 9 AM, Malia was doing her paperwork**—the part of the business she still couldn't delegate—when her assistant reminded her about tomorrow.

"Mrs. Chen's birthday. The cake is ready. The UH music students confirmed for 2 PM."

Mrs. Chen was ninety-three. Lived alone on Lanikaula Street. Malia had met her years ago delivering bread to a neighbor, found out Mrs. Chen couldn't leave her house anymore, couldn't get to a bakery. So Malia started dropping off a fresh loaf every week. Then she learned Mrs. Chen's birthday was coming. Then she found out no one was celebrating it.

Now Mrs. Chen got a cake every year. And a song. The UH Hilo music students loved the excuse to sing somewhere besides campus. Mrs. Chen cried every time.

Malia had forty-seven names on her shut-in list now. People who couldn't get to bakeries but still deserved birthday cakes. It cost her nothing—the cakes were excess she could produce in her sleep—but it meant everything to them.

This wasn't something she'd set out to do when she started baking. It wasn't part of the business plan. It was just what happened when you got really, really good at something. You produced more than you needed. More than the market needed. And then you had a choice.

You could try to hoard it—keep pushing for more sales, more profit, more accumulation. But that felt wrong. Like trying to dam a river. The excess wanted to flow.

Or you could give it away. Pour it back into your community. Invest it in discovery, in helping others find their footing, in small generosities that cost you nothing but meant everything.

Malia chose the latter. Every day. Not because she was particularly charitable or ambitious. But because this was what mastery looked like. This was what happened when you moved from eight loaves to a hundred to a thousand to more than the market could absorb.

You earned the opportunity to give freely.

You produced surplus that made your business resilient, your employees secure.

And then you produced excess that made your community better.

The shelters got fresh bread. Tyler got his cookie recipe. Mrs. Chen got her birthday cake. The high school students got real training. The ice cream shop got a shot at success.

And Malia got to keep baking.

Not because she had to.

Because she could.

Because she'd gotten so good that she'd moved past necessity, past surplus, into the strange and wonderful territory of excess.

And excess, she'd learned, came with an obligation.

To share it. To risk it. To give it away. To refuse to hoard it.

**This is what happens when you pursue mastery long enough.** You don't just get good. You get so good that your capacity exceeds what anyone is willing to pay for. And then you have a choice: discovery or generosity. Both are obligations. Both are valid. The question isn't which is better—the question is which fits your situation.

This isn't a story about charity. It's a story about what happens when you generate more than you need. About excellence. Mastery. And the quiet joy of producing so much value that you have abundance to give.

This was Tuesday morning in Hilo. This was Malia's life. This was what excess looked like.

And once you see it, you'll start seeing it everywhere.

## Section 2: The Widow's Mite, Reframed

There's an old story about a widow giving two small coins to the temple treasury. The wealthy gave large amounts, but she gave everything she had. Jesus noted that she gave more than all of them—not in amount, but in proportion.

The story is usually told to shame the wealthy. Look how much they gave and kept their excess. Look how much she sacrificed from her poverty.

But there's another reading: **The widow gave everything because she trusted something larger than herself.**

She had necessities—food, shelter, survival. Those two coins were probably her buffer. Her insurance against tomorrow. But she gave them anyway. Not because giving was virtuous in itself, but because she trusted that her necessities would be met. She had excess trust.

The rich man who gave much but kept most of his wealth? He was hoarding. He had massive excess—way beyond necessities, way beyond any reasonable buffer—and he kept it. The amount he gave was large. The proportion was small. And proportion reveals obligation.

**Generosity flows from trust, not from wealth.**

The widow had little money but enormous trust. The rich man had enormous money but little trust. She gave from excess (of trust). He hoarded despite excess (of wealth).

This is what makes excess relative. It's not about how much you have in absolute terms. It's about what's discretionary after necessities and a reasonable buffer. For the widow, trust was discretionary. For the rich man, wealth was. The question isn't "How much do you have?" The question is "What's left after prudence?"

And what's left—that's your excess. That's where obligation lives.

## Section 3: Recognizing the Three Piles

Remember the framework from Chapter 5—the Nail-Maker and his three piles?

| Pile | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Necessities | Survival + ability to keep producing | Must protect |
| Surplus | Buffer against bad days | Should maintain |
| Excess | More than security requires | Free to move |

Malia lived this progression. Eight loaves barely covering booth fees and flour—that's necessities. Every dollar spoken for. That's subsistence.

A hundred loaves with money left over after costs—that's surplus. She could reinvest. She could save. She had a buffer. Her business became resilient. That's security.

More loaves than Hilo could buy—that's excess. Capacity beyond what the market demands. Resources that are truly discretionary. That's where obligation emerges.

**Think about your own work. Does it generate more value than you strictly need to survive? That gap between what you produce and what you need is where surplus begins.**

Markets are extraordinarily good at generating surplus. Specialization, scale, efficiency—these create abundance. When you get good at something, you produce more than you consume. That's the unique power of markets. They turn individual excellence into collective plenty.

But surplus doesn't stop at security. If you keep getting better, if you keep producing, if you keep refining—surplus accumulates into excess. And excess is different from surplus.

Surplus is your buffer. It's prudent. It's what lets you survive bad months, make investments, build resilience. You should maintain your surplus. That's not hoarding—that's wisdom.

Excess is what's left after prudence. After your necessities are covered. After your buffer is sufficient. After you've accounted for reasonable contingencies and investments. What remains is truly discretionary. What remains is free to move.

**Think about your own resources—not just money, but time, knowledge, connections, capacity. After necessities and a reasonable buffer, is there anything left? That's your excess.**

And here's what makes excess different from profit: **Profit might be needed for reinvestment.** If you're growing a business, expanding capacity, hiring employees—that's surplus being deployed strategically. That's not excess yet. Excess is what remains after all reasonable reinvestment. Excess is what has no required destination.

**Excess is what remains after prudence.** That's where obligation lives. That's what asks something of you.

## Section 4: From Excess to Obligation

**Excess creates obligation.** Not guilt—obligation. The difference matters.

**Guilt says:** "You shouldn't have this. Having more than others is shameful. You need to give it away to atone."

**Obligation says:** "You have this—now what? You've generated capacity beyond necessity. What will you do with it?"

Guilt paralyzes. It makes you defensive. It makes you hide your excess, deny it, feel bad about having it. Guilt doesn't activate—it freezes.

Obligation activates. It turns excess into agency. It makes the question not "Should I have this?" but "What am I going to do with this?" Obligation is the fuel of responsibility.

**Think about a time you felt guilty about having more than you needed versus a time you felt obligated to do something with what you had. Which one moved you to action? That's the difference between guilt and obligation.**

Malia wasn't guilty about her four bakeries. She'd earned them. Thirty years of 4 AM mornings. Thousands of loaves. Mastery built slowly, deliberately, through relentless attention to craft. The bakeries were hers. The capacity was hers. The excess was hers.

But she felt obligated. Not to anyone specifically. Not because someone demanded it. But because excess comes with a question: **What do I do with what I have?**

And that question has two valid answers: **discovery or generosity.**

## Section 5: Path A — Discovery

**Discovery means:** Invest in exploration. Fund innovation. Take risks that might not pay off. Build things that don't exist yet.

Malia working on Tyler's ice cream sandwich cookie recipe—that's discovery. Six weekends of experimentation. No guarantee of success. No invoice. No contract. Just: here's a problem that's interesting, here's excess capacity I have, let's see if we can solve it.

If it works, Tyler and Jen get their signature product. Their business becomes sustainable. Hilo gets a unique local treat. But even if it doesn't work, they've discovered what doesn't work. And that's valuable too. That's learning.

**Discovery is investment in the future.** It's funding R&D. It's starting ventures. It's creating art. It's pursuing scientific research. It's trying things that might fail. It's learning new skills. It's building infrastructure for what could be.

**Think about something you've invested in that might not pay off—a skill, a project, a venture. Was that investment possible because you had excess beyond necessities and buffer? Discovery requires margin.**

Discovery matters because innovation extends human capacity. We don't solve new problems with old tools. We don't break through limitations by repeating what worked before. Discovery creates the new solutions. The new approaches. The new possibilities.

Future generations benefit from discovery today. The roads we drive on, the medicines we take, the technologies we use—all of that came from someone's excess deployed toward discovery. Someone had capacity beyond necessity, beyond buffer, and they invested it in something that might not work.

**Discovery is generosity to the future.**

### When Discovery Is Right

Discovery fits when:
- You have capacity for risk (the investment could fail and you'd be fine)
- You see opportunity others don't (your vantage point reveals possibilities)
- The potential return to humanity is high (even if financial return isn't)
- You're not neglecting present need to fund future possibility

Malia's time with Tyler isn't wrong because shelters need bread. Both can be true. She can give forty loaves to shelters *and* spend weekends on cookie recipes. That's what excess enables—multiple paths at once.

## Section 6: Path B — Generosity

**Generosity means:** Give to those who need. Fund what markets can't price. Support people in transition. Enable others' opportunity.

Malia's forty-seven birthday cakes for shut-ins—that's generosity. The forty loaves to shelters—that's generosity. Teaching at Hilo High—that's generosity. All of it costs her nothing (it's excess she can produce easily), but it means everything to recipients.

**Generosity is direct giving.** It's philanthropy. It's volunteering time. It's mentorship. It's community investment. It's using your excess to meet present need.

**Think about the most meaningful generosity you've experienced—given or received. Was it sustainable? Did it come from someone's excess, or did it require self-sacrifice? What made it possible?**

Generosity matters because not everyone has excess yet. Some people are still in subsistence—necessities barely covered, every dollar spoken for. Some have just reached surplus and are building their buffer. Discovery doesn't help them. They need present support. They need someone else's excess deployed now.

Some needs can't wait for innovation. Mrs. Chen doesn't need a new birthday cake technology. She needs someone to remember her. The shelters don't need better bread-making methods. They need bread today. Generosity meets the need that's visible right now.

**Generosity is obligation expressed now.**

### When Generosity Is Right

Generosity fits when:
- Immediate need is visible (someone needs help right now)
- Your excess can meet that need (you have what they need)
- Discovery won't help fast enough (innovation takes time they don't have)
- You're not sacrificing necessities (it's truly discretionary)

### The Balance

**Discovery or generosity. The question isn't which is better—both are obligations. The question is which fits your situation.**

Some excess goes to discovery. Some goes to generosity. The split depends on what you see, what you're positioned to do, what the moment requires.

- **Discovery:** Invests in the future, creates new capacity, takes time to show returns
- **Generosity:** Meets present need, restores dignity and connection, shows returns immediately

Neither is more virtuous. Both are valid responses to having excess. Both are ways of refusing to hoard. Both are ways of letting excess flow.

**How do you currently allocate your excess (if you have it)? Is it all discovery? All generosity? Some balance? Is that allocation intentional, or did it just happen?**

## Section 7: Sustainable Generosity

Here's what makes Malia's generosity sustainable: **it comes from excess, not from sacrifice.**

She's not giving from her necessities. She's not depleting her buffer. She's giving from the third pile—the loaves that wouldn't sell anyway, the capacity she has beyond what the market demands, the time she has now that her systems run smoothly.

**Sustainable generosity requires excess.** Self-immolation isn't sustainable. You can't give from empty. You can't pour from an empty cup.

This is the wisdom the widow's mite story sometimes obscures. If the widow kept giving everything, if she kept depleting her necessities, she'd collapse. Generosity that destroys the giver isn't generous—it's self-destructive. And when the giver collapses, the giving stops. That doesn't help anyone.

**Sustainable generosity protects necessities, maintains buffer, and gives from the third pile.**

That's not selfish. That's strategic. It means you can keep giving. You can give more over time. You can be a reliable source of support instead of a one-time burst that flames out.

This is why vocation matters. Why excellence matters. Why getting really, really good at something that generates value matters.

**Vocation is the path to influence.** Not vocation as "calling from God" necessarily, but vocation as "what you're excellent at that creates value for others."

If you want to be generous—if you want to have excess to give—become excellent first. Mastery generates surplus. Surplus becomes excess. Excess is what you give. Your job isn't just income. It's the engine of your obligation.

**Think about your work as the engine of your excess. If you became more excellent at it, would that generate more surplus? More excess? More capacity for obligation?**

This is the progression Malia lived:
```
Excellence → Surplus → Excess → Discovery/Generosity → Influence
```

She got really good at baking. That generated surplus (profit, security, buffer). That surplus turned into excess (capacity beyond what markets demand). That excess enabled discovery (Tyler's cookie project) and generosity (shelters, shut-ins, teaching). And that generated influence (a community shaped by her giving, young businesses finding their footing, teenagers learning a craft).

**If you want to have influence, start with excellence.** Not ambition (endless striving for more). Not productivity (extracting maximum output). Excellence. Getting really, really good at something that creates value. The rest follows from that.

## Section 8: What Happens When You Hoard

Not everyone uses their excess well. Some people accumulate and hold. They build buffers that become fortresses. They keep what's left after all prudent reserves. They refuse to let excess flow.

That's hoarding. And hoarding is a failure—economically, personally, and systemically.

### Economic Failure

**Capital parked is capital idle.** Money sitting in accounts doing nothing. Knowledge locked in heads and not shared. Time spent protecting what you have instead of deploying it. Connections hoarded instead of introduced.

The system needs excess to circulate. Velocity matters as much as volume. When excess flows—into discovery, into generosity, into new ventures, into community—it creates opportunity. It funds innovation. It meets needs. It generates more surplus downstream.

When excess stops moving, opportunity stops. Innovation starves. Needs go unmet. The surplus doesn't multiply—it just sits.

**Think about resources you've seen hoarded—by individuals, organizations, institutions. What happened to the system around them? Did the hoarding create flourishing or stagnation?**

### Personal Failure

Hoarding doesn't satisfy. It creates anxiety.

When you're in subsistence, the anxiety is real—you're worried about survival. When you're building surplus, the anxiety is productive—you're building security. But when you have excess and you hoard it? The anxiety just shifts.

**"Enough" keeps moving.** You reach the number you thought would make you secure, and immediately the goalpost shifts. Now you need more. The buffer that felt sufficient last year feels thin this year. The pile that seemed like excess starts feeling like barely-enough.

This is the psychology of hoarding: **the hoarder drowns in safety.** More resources don't reduce anxiety. They just raise the threshold. Enough never arrives.

**Have you ever noticed that more buffer doesn't reduce anxiety about having enough? The goalpost moves. That's the psychology of hoarding.**

### System Failure

When people with excess hoard it, others lack what they need. That's not just unfortunate—it's a system failure.

Not everyone has excess yet. Some people are still in subsistence. Some are building surplus but haven't reached security. When those who have excess refuse to deploy it—refuse discovery, refuse generosity, refuse to let it flow—the system becomes brittle.

Innovation starves because no one funds the risky experiments. Generosity networks thin because no one gives. Communities weaken because those with capacity hoard it instead of investing it locally.

**Hoarding is extraction without return.** Taking value from the system (through markets, through employment, through opportunities) but refusing to put value back in. That's not sustainable. That kills systems.

## Section 9: Jobs to Be Done

Here's why your excess matters specifically: **Only you know what you value. Only you can see the opportunities in front of you.**

Distant planners can't see Mrs. Chen's birthday. They can't see Tyler's cookie problem. They can't see the specific needs in your community, the specific opportunities in your network, the specific ways your excess could flow productively.

**You see needs others don't.** You have opportunities others don't. Your excess is positioned uniquely. You're embedded in contexts that reveal specific jobs to be done—problems that could be solved, people who could be helped, innovations that could happen.

**No one else can deploy your excess like you can.** Not because you're special, but because you're positioned differently. You see different needs. You have different capacity. You have different relationships.

**What needs do you see that others miss? What opportunities are visible to you because of where you stand? That visibility is part of your obligation.**

This is why top-down redistribution is inefficient. It's not that collective action never works—safety-commons logic is essential for pooling risk and providing impartial services. But when it comes to deploying discretionary resources, you have information advantages. You can see things central planners can't.

Your job is to use those advantages. To deploy your excess toward the jobs you can see. To fund the discovery you believe in. To give to the needs you recognize. That's not selfishness—that's using local knowledge wisely.

## Section 10: The Call to Self-Discipline

**The mature operator disciplines their own excess—not because someone forces them, but because they understand obligation.**

This is a call to self-discipline. Not because self-discipline is virtuous in itself, but because the alternative is worse.

If those with excess don't self-discipline—if they hoard, if they refuse obligation, if they keep accumulating without deploying—external discipline arrives. Taxation. Regulation. Revolution. Systems correct when participants won't.

External discipline is less efficient and more destructive. It can't see the local jobs to be done. It can't allocate based on your specific knowledge. It treats all excess the same, applies uniform rules, and often destroys the surplus-generating capacity in the process.

**Self-discipline is freedom. External discipline is constraint.**

You have a choice: deploy your excess voluntarily, or have it taken involuntarily. Fund discovery yourself, or have government fund it through taxation. Give generously yourself, or have redistribution imposed. The choice is yours—but only if you choose. If you hoard, the choice gets made for you.

**Excess demands movement.** It's not meant to sit idle. It's not meant to be hoarded. It's meant to flow—into discovery, into generosity, into building, into giving.

Choose discovery or generosity. Both are valid. Both are obligations. The question isn't which is better. The question is: are you hoarding, or are you deploying?

**Choose one. But choose.**

## Section 11: What You Can Now See

You can see the three piles now. Necessities—what you need to survive and keep producing. Surplus—your buffer against bad days, your reinvestment capacity, your security. Excess—what's left after prudence, truly discretionary, free to move.

**Your own excess is probably larger than you think.** Not just money. Time. Knowledge. Connections. Capacity. Attention. All of it has three piles. All of it generates excess if you're excellent. And all of that excess comes with obligation.

You can see the progression now. Excellence → Surplus → Excess. Malia moved through it over thirty years. You're somewhere in that progression. Maybe you're still in subsistence, every resource spoken for. Maybe you're building surplus, creating your buffer. Maybe you've reached excess and you're just recognizing it for the first time.

Wherever you are, you can see where excess lives. And if you have it, you can see what it asks of you.

You can see the two paths now. **Discovery (invest in future) or generosity (meet present need).** Both are valid. Both are obligations. The question isn't which is better—the question is which fits your situation. What needs do you see? What opportunities are visible to you? What can your excess enable?

You can see hoarding now. When "enough" keeps moving. When the buffer becomes a fortress. When anxiety replaces obligation. When accumulation becomes the goal instead of deployment. Hoarding is visible now—in systems, in others, in yourself.

And you can see the question that matters: **Who am I inside this?**

Not "What should I do?"—that's too prescriptive, too one-size-fits-all. But "Who am I inside this?" How do I show up with my excess? How does my excellence create surplus? Where can my excess flow? What do I want to build with what's left?

**In your family—how do you show up with excess?** Are you the one who gives time? Who funds opportunity? Who mentors? Who creates space for others?

**In your work—how does your excellence create surplus?** Are you generating value beyond your own consumption? Are you becoming more capable each year? Is your work the engine of your obligation?

**In your community—where can your excess flow?** What needs do you see that others miss? What could you enable? What jobs are visible to you?

**In your vision—what do you want to build with what's left?** Not what you should build. Not what others expect. But what you want. What calls to you. What you believe could matter.

## Section 12: The Implication

**Excess isn't the problem. Hoarding is.**

You have more than you need—or you will, if you pursue excellence. Markets generate surplus. Mastery creates excess. That's not shameful. That's not something to feel guilty about. That's the natural result of getting really, really good at something that creates value.

The question isn't whether to have excess. The question is what you do with it.

**Discovery or generosity. Choose one. But choose.**

Don't hoard. Don't let "enough" keep moving. Don't build fortresses. Don't let anxiety replace obligation. Let it flow. Into discovery that funds the future. Into generosity that meets present need. Into building. Into giving. Into whatever your excess is uniquely positioned to enable.

You can see your three piles now. You know where excess lives. You know it comes with obligation. You know the two paths. You know what hoarding looks like.

**The next time someone tells you that having more than you need is shameful—or that keeping everything is prudent—you'll recognize what they're missing.** Excess is the natural result of excellence. The question isn't whether to have it. The question is what you do with it.

You can see the progression now. You can see where you are in it. You can see what your excess could enable.

Now the question is: Will you deploy it, or will you hoard it?

That's the choice. And it's yours to make.

## Section 13: What Comes Next

Discovery or generosity. That's where excess goes. But making this choice wisely—over a lifetime, across all four habitats, through changing circumstances—requires something more than just seeing the obligation.

It requires stewardship.

Not ownership—you don't control the systems you're navigating. Not passivity—you have real agency, real choices to make. But stewardship: operating wisely inside a world you inherited. Systems you didn't create. Opportunities you were given. Excess that came not just from your effort, but from the infrastructure and relationships and lucky accidents that positioned you.

You can navigate The Ring. You know which tool fits which moment. You can see your excess and what it asks of you. But how do you operate wisely over time? How do you make these choices again and again without burning out, without losing sight, without becoming the hoarder or the self-immolator?

That's stewardship. And that's what comes next.
