**Chapter 2**

**The Broken Line**

**The Line in Your Head**

Try this experiment.

Picture politics for a second---not the messy real-life version with yard signs and awkward Thanksgiving arguments, but the way it's drawn on a whiteboard.

What appears?

For most people, it's a straight line.

On the far left: *communism*. Somewhere between the middle and the left: *socialism*. On the right: *capitalism*. If the word *anarchy* shows up at all, it's usually spray-painted off to the side like a warning label: **danger---collapse ahead**.

We learn this line early. It shows up in high school civics, in news graphics with blue and red bars, in online quizzes promising to tell you "where you fall on the political spectrum." The details change, but the map is always the same: one dimension, one axis, one fight.

If you took one of those quizzes not long ago, the kind that asks rapid-fire questions:

Should healthcare be government-run?\
Should taxes on the wealthy go up or down?\
Should public services be privatized?

Then it spits out a little dot on a line: *You are slightly left of center*, it declared, as if that settled the matter. As if that one dot could tell others how you think about your kids, your city, your job, your faith, your friendships, your ideal tax code, and whether you trust the DMV.

A single dot. On a single line.

You've probably seen more dramatic versions of the same thing: talk-show segments where one guest is the "conservative voice" and the other is the "liberal voice," or opinion pages that promise to present both "the left" and "the right." Left means one bundle of ideas; right means another bundle. Everyone's supposed to pick a side or at least find a respectable place somewhere in the middle.

In that world, capitalism, socialism, communism, and anarchy aren't just tools or arrangements anymore. They're your team's jerseys or a diagnosis of everyone else.

- **Anarchy** isn't "from voluntary cooperation comes complex self-adapting natural systems" it's an animalistic "everything comes down to survival of the fittest."

- **Capitalism** isn't "individual innovation aligned to evolving value of community's needs."; it's a heartless "amassing absurd wealth on the backs of the weak or unlucky."

- **Socialism** isn't "the commonwealth share applied to collected benefit by economies of scale; it's a thoughtlessly "placation of personal guilt via misguided systems of dependency."

- **Communism** isn't "selfless generosity to the shared greater good "; it's a tantrumatic "we will eat the rich!"

Meanwhile, real life stubbornly refuses to cooperate with the poster.

In the last chapter, we looked at how people already live with **different logics at different scales**:

- We don't demand payment of compensation from our kids when they raid the food we bought from fridge. We don't live like at hoc roommates or visitors in an abandoned hostile or wilderness campsite. At home, we behave like miniature **communists**: *from each according to their ability, to each according to their need* feels obvious---the experts and the decision makers are both in control and making the greatest sacrifices.

- We don't want private subscription fire departments competing on price to show up at a burning house. For police, fire, rescue, roadways, the military, we instinctively expect **socialist** rules: collectively funded, universally available---promoting the general welfare of the community and access to critical share services that are nearly impossible at an individual level but quite affordable collectively due to economies of scale.

- At the level of the wider economy, we mostly rely on **capitalist** markets---prices, profits, competition---to allow individuals to decide on how to allocate resources and generate surplus through transactions on underlying civil platforms---where value is subject to individual context, value is determined by the individual.

- And with friends, we often live something like **anarchists** in the good sense: no formal boss, no central planner, just voluntary cooperation and a pattern that emerges over time---with something brilliantly similar to family emerging over time in deep friendships that bend the line into a circle and we see the *unregulated* and *most strictly governed* relationships in human life mirroring and operating most closely.

Yet that's not how we're taught to think about it. Instead, the same flat line is supposed to describe how we feel about all of those scales at once.

***\[Insert Line Graphic\]***

You're *left* or *right*. You're *for* markets or *for* the state. You're *anti-communist* or *anti-capitalist*. The left/right line pretends there's one clean continuum, and the only responsible thing to do is to choose the right neighborhood on it.

But that line is not a law of nature. It's not carved into stone somewhere behind the Lincoln Memorial. It's a human invention---a rough mental shortcut that got drawn, redrawn, and weaponized over the last couple of centuries.

Like any map, it reflects the problems of the people who drew it. Then it outlived them, moved into our textbooks and search results, and started answering questions it was never designed to answer.

To understand why it keeps failing us now---why it can't swallow a slug line at the Pentagon, or a modern economy, or your family without choking---we need to go back to the room where "left" and "right" were born.

Not in Washington. In Paris.

**How a Seating Chart Became a Spectrum**

In the late 1780s, if you'd walked into the French National Assembly and looked down from the gallery, you would have seen something deceptively simple: a big room, a presiding officer up front, rows of seats, and a strange new country trying to invent itself.

France had just spent centuries under a monarchy. Kings, nobles, and clergy were the default setting. Then the old order cracked. Revolutionaries toppled the king's authority and tried to replace it with something called "the nation."

The problem was: nobody agreed on what that actually meant.

In the Assembly, deputies had wildly different ideas about how much of the old world to preserve and how much to burn down. Some wanted to keep the king but put him on a constitutional leash. Others wanted to strip him of power entirely. Some trusted the church; others wanted it neutered or nationalized. Some feared the Paris mob more than the king. Others felt exactly the opposite.

So they did what humans always do in chaotic meetings: they sorted themselves.

Those who broadly **supported the king and the old hierarchy** tended to sit to the presiding officer's **right**. Those who pushed for **more radical change**---curbing royal power, elevating the commoners, expanding rights---gravitated to the **left**.

Nobody thought they were inventing a permanent political axis. They were just clustering by instinct:

- On the **right**: defenders of tradition, hierarchy, altar and throne.

- On the **left**: champions of reform, popular sovereignty, and---eventually---more radical equality.

Reporters and pamphleteers noticed the pattern. They started referring to "the men on the left" and "the men on the right." The labels stuck.

At this point, it's crucial to see what "left" and "right" mainly meant:

They weren't grand philosophies of economics. There was no bar with capitalism on one end and communism on the other. Karl Marx hadn't even been born yet.

"Left" meant, roughly: **less power for the old order, more for the new nation.**

"Right" meant, roughly: **protect the old order, or at least change it carefully.**

These were attitudes toward **existing hierarchy and the speed of change**, not fully developed systems. And even in that room, reality was more complicated than two camps. Some "right" deputies wanted serious reform. Some "left" deputies still believed in kings, just weaker ones. There were centrists and hybrids and contradictions.

But "left" and "right" were catchy. They turned a messy five-dimensional argument---about religion, class, monarchy, property, law---into something you could talk about in a sentence.

They were the first draft of the line in your head.

Over the 19th century, as revolutions and counter-revolutions rolled across Europe, the language hardened. "Left" became associated with republicans, anticlericals, workers' movements. "Right" stayed associated with monarchists, church defenders, aristocrats. The French seating chart had metastasized into a vocabulary.

Then the industrial revolution slammed into everything.

**Factories, Manifestos, and the New "Left"**

Imagine standing outside a factory in Manchester or Berlin in the mid-1800s.

You'd see something new: huge buildings, machines, workers pouring in at dawn and out after dusk, soot, noise, repetition. People who had once been tied to land, family trades, or small workshops now spent their lives as cogs in large industrial systems they didn't own and barely influenced.

Out of this world came new ideas that would soon crowd onto the "left" side of the line.

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were watching the same industrial scene and drawing radical conclusions. They argued that the real engine of history was **class conflict** between those who owned the means of production and those who didn't. They didn't just want kinder bosses or safer factories; they wanted a **different ownership structure** altogether.

Their proposal, in brutally simple form, was:

- Abolish private ownership of the big productive stuff---factories, major land, capital.

- Put it all under collective ownership---"the workers" or "the people."

- Run the economy by plan rather than by markets.

This is where that phrase **"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"** shows up: as the end-state ideal of a fully communist society.

As socialist and communist parties formed in various countries, they planted themselves squarely on the **left**. They were anti-monarchy, pro-republic, and now also **anti-capitalist** in a much deeper sense. They wanted to replace markets and private capital with collective planning and ownership.

Across the aisle---on the **right**---landowners, industrialists, and others defended property rights, markets, and traditional authority structures. They warned that socialist and communist experiments would wreck incentives, destroy freedom, and unleash chaos.

But notice how many different dimensions are bundled together:

- Defending **private property** and **market exchange**

- Defending **traditional religion**

- Defending **monarchy** or strong centralized rulers

- Preferring **slower change** over rapid upheaval

All of that ended up packaged as "right." On the other side, a similarly messy bundle---anticlerical secularism, radical democracy, labor movements, egalitarian rhetoric, and eventually communist revolution---got packaged as "left."

By the early 20th century, parliaments around the world had internalized this seating chart logic. Social democratic, socialist, and labor parties took the "left" benches; conservative, liberal (in the classical sense), and Christian democratic parties took the "right." The precise policies differed wildly by country, but the mental map was set.

Then the 20th century did what it does: it raised the stakes.

**Cold War: The Line Turns into a Front Line**

If the French Revolution birthed the left/right line, the Cold War carved it into stone.

After World War II, two superpowers faced each other across continents, missiles, and slogans:

- The **United States** and its allies, presenting themselves as the **"free world"**---democratic, capitalist, individualist.

- The **Soviet Union** and its allies, presenting themselves as the **"socialist camp"**---vanguard of the workers, enemies of imperialism and capitalism.

Both sides invested enormous energy in telling stories about themselves and the other. In schoolbooks, political speeches, propaganda posters, and movies, the rough 19th-century spectrum got sharpened into a binary:

- On one end: **capitalism**---free markets, private property, limited government, political pluralism.

- On the other end: **communism**---planned economy, state ownership, one-party rule.

In between, in some diagrams, you might see **socialism** or **social democracy** marked as a midpoint: more state, more redistribution, more planning than capitalism, less than full communism.

The message was simple: pick a side on the line.

On the American side, this period produced a familiar rhetorical move: anything that smelled like socialism could be rhetorically nudged down the slope toward communism. Universal healthcare? Slippery slope. Strong unions? Slippery slope. Higher taxes on the rich? Slippery slope. The line helped tell a story in which all of those things were steps toward the same end.

On the Soviet side, the move was similar but inverted. Capitalism wasn't just one economic system among others; it was the enemy system, the root of imperialism, exploitation, and war. To be "on the left" was to be morally and historically on the right side of destiny.

Democracies in Europe complicated the picture. Countries like Sweden, Germany, and the UK experimented with **welfare states**, public healthcare, and social insurance while maintaining robust markets and private property. But in the simplified story, those were still placed somewhere between capitalism and communism on the same line, as if they were waypoints along a single road.

If you grew up in the late 20th century in almost any industrial country, you absorbed some Cold War version of this diagram. Even if your teachers were more nuanced, the culture handed you two team names---"capitalist" and "socialist"---and whispered that everything else was just moderation or compromise between them.

Anarchy, in this story, barely got a say. When it showed up at all, it was usually as the ugly end state of failure: what happens when the state collapses or when society "descends into anarchy." Never mind the long tradition of thinkers who saw voluntary cooperation and self-organizing communities as a kind of order, not the absence of it.

The line had done its work. It started as a seating chart, turned into a shorthand for attitudes toward monarchy, and ended up as a battlefield diagram for a global ideological war.

After that, shrinking it down to fit a TV screen was easy.

**When the Line Became a Scoreboard**

Once you have a simple line and two big teams on it, it's irresistible to everyone who needs a shortcut: journalists, pollsters, campaign consultants, social media platforms.

The line wasn't just a theory anymore. It became an organizing principle for everyday political talk.

Turn on cable news in almost any country with two dominant parties and you'll see it. One party is branded "center-right," the other "center-left." Primary challengers are "far right" or "hard left." Pundits fret about "polarization," imagining the two parties sliding toward the extremes on either end.

Graphic designers do their part: they draw the familiar horizontal bar, shade the left side blue and the right side red (or vice versa), and place candidates or parties along it. Pollsters run surveys and declare that the "median voter" lives here, the "base" lives there.

You can even see the line in how we talk about people:

- "She's pretty conservative, but not extreme."

- "He's a socialist now."

- "I'm fiscally conservative but socially liberal."

- "I'm in the center. I dislike both extremes."

All of those statements imagine a single axis and a single self: you slide left or right, and that's who you are.

The left/right line turned politics from a sprawling argument about concrete problems---How do we educate our kids? How do we handle crime? Who pays for what?---into something like a spectator sport. The important thing became less *what* you were for and more *whose side* you were on.

Once you pick a side, the line quietly hands you a bundle of pre-sorted answers:

- If you're **"on the right,"** you're supposed to like markets, distrust taxes, support the police, value tradition, and view "socialism" with suspicion, if not horror.

- If you're **"on the left,"** you're supposed to like redistribution, distrust corporations, support protest movements, value social change, and view "capitalism" with suspicion, if not horror.

You may personally deviate from the script---real humans do---but the social pressure is there. Deviating too far can cost you friends, status, or even your sense of belonging.

So capitalism and socialism stop being simply **ways of arranging parts of society** and become identities. "I am a capitalist" or "I am a socialist" starts sounding as natural as "I am an American" or "I am a Christian" or "I am a fan of this sports team."

Communism gets treated less as a specific family of economic arrangements and more as a moral label: hero, villain, or cautionary tale depending on where you stand. Anarchy becomes an all-purpose synonym for chaos. Nobody asks what concrete situations might actually call for each of these logics; they ask which jersey you're wearing.

And that's where the line starts to collide with the world we actually live in.

Because the world isn't built on a single axis.

It's built out of families, neighborhoods, markets, ministries, networks, clubs, companies, governments, digital platforms, informal crews of friends---the whole system-of-systems that surfaced for a moment in the slug line outside the Pentagon.

If the Prologue's "ride that shouldn't have worked" uncovers anything, it's that real solutions often come from **blends**: public infrastructure, private incentives, social trust, and emergent norms all working together. The left/right line was never built to describe that kind of complexity.

But we keep trying to use it anyway.

**What the Line Flattens**

The left/right line does something subtle and dangerous.

It doesn't just simplify. It **flattens**.

It takes a whole stack of different questions and compresses them into one:

- How big is the group we're talking about?

- Who decides what?

- What is this system trying to protect or promote?

- Who do we mean by "us"?

- Which tools fit this particular scale of life?

All of that gets mashed into: *Where are you on the spectrum?*

Let's peel back a few of those flattened layers.

**1. Scale: How Big Is the "We"?**

The first question is basic and almost never mentioned on talk shows: **what scale are we talking about?**

- A household of four?

- A neighborhood?

- A city?

- A nation of 300 million?

- A global market of billions?

In your own life, you already behave like a scale-specialist.

At the family level, communism in the narrow sense---"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need"---feels natural. You don't meter out dinner by income or invoice your teenager for electricity. The "we" is small, intimate, and permanent enough that shared ownership and need-based distribution make sense.

At the level of **public safety**, you act like a socialist. You expect police, fire, rescue, and national defense to be **collectively funded and universally available**. You don't want the fire department to ask for your credit card before spraying water on your roof or have to pave your own way to work.

At the level of **society-wide production and trade**, you mostly rely on capitalist markets---prices sending signals, businesses chasing profit, competition driving innovation. You don't want Congress setting the price of each model of smartphone or the menu at every restaurant.

And at the level of **friendship groups and informal networks**, you drift toward positive anarchy: no one's formally in charge; people opt in and out; roles and influence shift as situations change.

Four different logics. Four different "home habitats." Same human being.

The left/right line doesn't know what to do with that. It treats "government" as a single blob, as if the same attitude that makes sense about national tax policy should also apply to how you handle your kids' chores, or how your city organizes its firefighters.

So people import a **national-scale attitude** into intimate life ("families should operate like little free-market firms" or "the nation should operate like one big family"), and things get weird.

**2. Authority: Who Decides, and How?**

Another layer the line flattens is **authority**: who gets to decide, and by what process?

Think of a few contrasting arrangements:

- A monarch issuing decrees from above

- An elected legislature passing laws

- A CEO and a board steering a company

- A decentralized market where millions of buyers and sellers set prices without central command

- A leaderless online community where norms emerge from many small interactions

Two policies can be identical in outcome but very different in authority. A state can cap rents in a city by law, or landlords can voluntarily coordinate to keep rents affordable. A company can mandate a dress code, or employees can drift into shared expectations without anyone writing them down.

On the left/right line, we're told that "left" means more state power and "right" means less. But in practice, both "left" and "right" can favor strong centralized authority when it suits their goals. Both can also support decentralized decision-making---markets, local autonomy, community norms---when that serves their purposes.

The line hides those differences. It doesn't tell you whether a policy is centralized or decentralized, whether authority is concentrated or dispersed. It just tells you whether you're supposed to cheer.

**3. Moral Vision: What Are We Protecting?**

Politics isn't just about mechanisms. It's about **moral visions**---views of what's good, right, and worth protecting.

Different people, even on the same "side," prioritize different things:

- **Freedom** from interference

- **Equality** of status, opportunity, or outcome

- **Order** and stability

- **Loyalty** to nation, family, community

- **Care** for the vulnerable

- **Sanctity** of certain institutions or ways of life

Two people "on the left" might both support higher taxes, but one is animated by compassion for the poor, the other by resentment of the rich. Two people "on the right" might both oppose a regulation, but one is driven by love of entrepreneurial risk, the other by distrust of a distant bureaucracy.

The line pretends that all of these moral differences fit neatly into "left values" and "right values." It turns complex moral ecosystems into brand packages.

**4. Tribe: Who Counts as "Us"?**

Then there's **tribe**---who we imagine when we say "we."

Is "we" your extended family? Your class? Your nation? Your co-religionists? Your party? Your online community?

Someone can be "left-wing" in economic terms but intensely nationalistic, caring mainly about redistributing within the bounds of a single ethnic group or culture. Someone else can be "right-wing" on taxes but deeply cosmopolitan, thinking in terms of humanity as a whole.

The left/right line smooshes those tribal differences together. It lures us into thinking "my side" is a coherent community with shared interests, when often it's an uneasy coalition of different tribes temporarily agreeing on a few issues.

When you put all this together, the problem comes into focus.

The line doesn't just simplify. It **forces everything---scale, authority, moral vision, tribe---onto a single axis.**

Once that axis is in place, communism, socialism, capitalism, and anarchy stop being **different tools for different jobs** and start being **rival tribes fighting for control of the whole landscape.**

Instead of asking, "Where does this logic work best?" we ask, "Which logic should rule everything?"

That's how you end up trying to run a family like a corporation, a corporation like a family, a nation like a small commune, or a friendship group like a miniature HR department---and wondering why it feels wrong.

To see how badly the line misfires, we don't need a new theory. We just need to walk back outside, look at actual systems, and ask: where would we even put this on the spectrum?

Let's go back to that parking lot at the Pentagon.

**When the Line Meets the Parking Lot**

In the Prologue, we watched a strange little world snap into focus in the morning rush around the Pentagon: the **slug line**.

A temporary city of commuters forms there every day, governed by a handful of crude signs, unwritten rules, and shared expectations. Strangers line up, climb into other strangers' cars, and streak into the HOV lanes. No tickets, no app, no centralized dispatcher.

The ride shouldn't have worked. But it did.

What made it possible?

- **Public infrastructure**: the roads, the HOV lanes, the Pentagon bus stops, the zoning and traffic rules---all the stuff only a large public authority can realistically build and maintain.

- **Market-like incentives**: drivers want to use the faster HOV lanes; riders want a cheap, quick commute. Everyone saves time and hassle.

- **Social trust and norms**: people don't abduct each other or drive off to Florida. They follow unwritten rules: where to line up, which destinations get priority, when to say no.

- **Emergent order**: nobody planned the slug line system from the top down. It emerged from many local experiments and stabilized because it worked.

Try to place that on the left/right line.

Is the slug line **capitalist**? In one sense, yes: it's voluntary, based on individual incentives, piggybacks on private cars, and revolves around mutually beneficial exchange.

Is it **socialist**? Also yes: it depends entirely on **collectively funded public infrastructure** and rules. No government-built roads, no HOV lanes, no Pentagon transit hub---no slug line.

Is it **communist** in the family-scale sense? Not really, but maybe. People aren't sharing everything in common, and there's no "from each to each" ethic. But there is a faint echo: strangers are willing to share their space and time with people they'll never see again because they see themselves as part of a larger commuting "we." There is the green Acura who had ability and a rider with a need after the witching hour who had nothing to offer. So maybe.

Is it **anarchic**? In a sense, yes---the good kind. There's no central authority assigning cars to riders. Order arises from voluntary cooperation and shared norms, not from a command center. There is an emergent culture and social etiquette that riders and drives adopt of their own volition.

On the standard spectrum poster, this thing is an embarrassment. It refuses to sit neatly on the line.

That's the point.

Real systems---especially the ones that work surprisingly well---don't respect our ideological diagrams. They layer and blend different logics:

- Public and private

- Planned and emergent

- Rule-bound and trust-based

- Individual incentives and shared goods

The slug line is not alone. Once you start looking, you see hybrid systems everywhere:

- **Public roads** used by **private delivery companies** carrying packages bought on **online marketplaces** governed by a mix of corporate policies, worker norms, and state regulations.

- **Public schools** funded by taxes, with **private vendors** supplying books, food and buses, **volunteer PTAs** fundraising, and informal networks of parents swapping information and ideas.

- **Disaster response**, where federal agencies, local governments, nonprofits, churches, businesses, and spontaneous volunteer groups all operate side by side.

None of those fit neutrally along a single left/right axis. Each one is a **system of systems**, combining elements that our ideological jerseys tell us are supposed to belong to rival tribes.

If you insist on forcing them onto the line, you start ignoring the parts that don't fit your team's story.

A free-market enthusiast might emphasize the voluntary, self-organizing nature of the slug line and downplay the fact that it only exists because of public roads and state power to enforce traffic rules.

A state-centered enthusiast might emphasize the infrastructure and laws and treat the emergent, self-organizing side as a trivial footnote.

Both miss the actual magic: the interaction of systems that "shouldn't" go together, according to the poster.

And just as the slug line refuses to stay put on the spectrum, so do the **different scales of life** we walked through in Chapter 1:

- **Family** isn't properly left or right. It's its own ecosystem.

- **Public safety** isn't simply "big government" versus "small government." It's a specialized socialist pocket we broadly accept without thinking of it as such.

- **Markets** aren't pure capitalism or pure socialism; in practice, they always operate under some legal and moral constraints.

- **Friend groups and informal networks** don't show up on most charts, but they're where we experience non-hierarchical, emergent order most directly.

When you start to see these patterns, the left/right line begins to look less like a helpful compass and more like a blunt instrument of dogma meant to box in a base and keep it angry. It's not just that the map is incomplete.

It's that the map is **broken.**

**Dropping the Line, Finding the Map**

So where does that leave us?

We're not going to fix the left/right line by arguing about where to put the labels. People have been tinkering with the spectrum for years---adding a second axis, splitting "economic" from "social," inventing four quadrants instead of two.

Those can be useful, but they still start with the same assumption: that the important thing is to locate **you** on the map.

Are you left or right? Libertarian or authoritarian? Center-left or center-right? What's your dot?

The argument of this book is different.

The primary question isn't **"Where do you fall?"**

The primary question is **"Where do these systems belong?"**

Communism, socialism, capitalism, and anarchy are not Hogwarts houses you get sorted into. They're patterns of organizing life---tools. Like any tools, they're very effective in some contexts and disastrous in others.

We've seen hints of their "natural habitats" already:

- Communism as the natural logic of the **family**: from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.

- Socialism as the natural logic of **public safety and defense**: collectively funded, universally available services.

- Capitalism as the natural logic of **society-wide markets**: decentralized, price-driven allocation and surplus generation.

- Anarchy, in the positive sense, as the natural logic of **friendships and emergent networks**: voluntary cooperation leading to complex, self-adapting orders.

The left/right line doesn't want you to think that way. It wants to know whether you're for or against *each* of these systems in the abstract, as if they were rival gods competing for your worship.

But reality doesn't care about the line. Reality cares about **fit**:

- Does this rule set match this scale?

- Does this pattern of authority match these relationships?

- Does this moral vision match the kind of "we" we're dealing with?

If we start answering those questions honestly, we'll end up with a very different kind of map---one where the key feature is not a straight line but a set of **connected zones**, each with its own native ecosystem, and plenty of borderlands where systems overlap.

Before we can draw that map, we need to go down a level.

Big words like "capitalism" and "socialism" are easiest to argue about when they're abstract. They're hardest to understand where they actually live: in our daily lives, our habits, our loyalties, our families.

If "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need" is how we naturally treat our kids and spouses, what does that tell us about communism as an idea?

Why does that logic feel so right at the kitchen table---and so wrong when a government of millions tries to impose it on everyone?

What happens when a system that fits one scale perfectly escapes its home habitat and tries to run everything else?

Those are the questions that start to turn a broken line into a real map.

And the best place to begin is not with a manifesto or a law book, but with the smallest "we" most of us will ever belong to.

The family. The first little commune. The table where "from each, to each" first felt like simple common sense.
