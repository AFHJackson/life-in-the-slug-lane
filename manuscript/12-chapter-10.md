**CHAPTER 10: STEWARDSHIP**

**Opening: The Stewardship Dilemma**

Six months into her job at a regional hospital network, Maya started seeing the pattern.

The hospital served three counties---urban, suburban, and rural. The mission statement in the lobby talked about \"excellent care for all patients.\" The quarterly reports talked about \"operational efficiency\" and \"margin improvement.\"

Those two stories were colliding in the scheduling software.

Maya\'s team managed patient appointments across the network\'s clinics. The software had been optimized---that was the word management used---to reduce \"no-show waste.\" It tracked which patients missed appointments, which zip codes had the highest cancellation rates, which insurance types were most likely to reschedule.

Then it started quietly adjusting availability.

If you lived in the rural county and had Medicaid, the system now offered you fewer appointment slots. Not zero. Just fewer. And later. The algorithm had decided you were \"high-risk\" for wasting the clinic\'s time.

Maya watched this happen over months. She raised it in team meetings. She got nodded at. She escalated to her director. She got thanked for her diligence and told that \"the system is working as designed to maximize throughput.\"

She started having dreams about spreadsheets.

One night she sat at her kitchen table with a glass of wine and a question that wouldn\'t let go:

*Do I try to fix this? Do I leave? Do I just... endure?*

None of the options felt clean.

If she pushed harder, she\'d burn political capital she didn\'t have, probably accomplish nothing, and make her own job miserable. If she left, someone less bothered would take her seat, and the algorithm would keep quietly sorting people. If she stayed and stopped fighting, she\'d become complicit in something that felt fundamentally wrong---using efficiency language to make poor people wait longer for care.

She couldn\'t fix the whole healthcare system. She couldn\'t redesign the incentive structures that made hospitals chase margins. She couldn\'t rewrite insurance policy or Medicaid reimbursement rates.

But she also couldn\'t pretend she didn\'t see what the software was doing.

This is the stewardship dilemma.

You live inside systems you didn\'t design. Many of them are hybrids---beautifully tangled mixes of market incentives, public funding, safety regulations, and voluntary effort. Some are working well. Some are breaking in ways that hurt real people.

And you have to decide: what do you do with the power you actually have?

You can\'t redesign everything. But you\'re not helpless either.

The question isn\'t whether you\'ll participate in imperfect systems. You already do. The question is *how*---with what posture, what boundaries, what long-game vision, what willingness to act when the cost is real.

This chapter is about that work.

Not a checklist. Not a guarantee. But a set of questions and principles that can help you tend the hybrids you live inside---faithfully, without illusion, and without burning out.

We\'ll start by assembling the complete toolkit.

**Synthesis: How the Tools Work Together**

By this point in the book, you\'ve collected three sets of tools.

First, the **ring**---the map of four habitats where different logics belong:

- Family/communism (intimate scale, from-each-to-each)

- Safety commons/socialism (collective essentials, impartial protection)

- Markets/capitalism (surplus engine, individual value at scale)

- Friendship/anarchy (voluntary cooperation, emergent order)

Second, the **compass**---the four dials that help you locate any situation:

- Resolution (one-to-one vs. one-to-population)

- Value basis (shared needs vs. individual preferences)

- Authority shape (centralized vs. decentralized)

- Identity carrier (given identity vs. chosen identity)

Third, the **internal framework** from Chapter 9---your personal operating system:

- Vocation/calling (excellence generates surplus → excess → discovery/generosity)

- Jobs-to-be-done (only you can know what you value)

- Identity formation (voluntary networks shape who you become at scale)

- Self-discipline (the moral center you carry into every habitat)

These aren\'t separate tools. They\'re meant to work together.

Think of them like this:

The **ring** tells you *what kind of system you\'re in*---which habitat\'s logic is (or should be) operating.

The **compass** tells you *where you are inside it*---at what scale, with what kind of authority, serving what kind of value.

The **internal framework** tells you *who you are and what you can do*---your agency, your integrity, your long-game purpose.

Let\'s watch them work together in Maya\'s situation.

**Using the ring:** Maya\'s hospital is a hybrid. It operates in the *safety commons* habitat (healthcare is a shared human need, funded collectively through insurance/taxes, expected to treat people impartially). But it\'s also operating in the *market* habitat (private network competing for patients, optimizing for financial margin). Those two logics are colliding in the scheduling software.

The algorithm is importing pure market efficiency into a space that\'s supposed to run on impartial protection. It\'s treating \"high no-show risk\" as if it were a normal market signal (rational resource allocation) instead of what it actually is: a symptom of transportation barriers, childcare gaps, work schedule inflexibility---structural problems that safety systems are supposed to address, not amplify.

**Using the compass:**

- Resolution: Maya is one-to-one with her team and director, but one-to-population with the patients affected by the system.

- Value basis: The patients\' need for healthcare is a *shared human need*, not an *individual preference*. The algorithm is treating it like the latter.

- Authority: Highly centralized in software decisions made by people Maya will never meet.

- Identity: Maya carries both given identity (human, neighbor) and chosen identity (healthcare administrator who wants to reduce suffering, not manage it).

**Using the internal framework:**

- Maya\'s vocation is in healthcare operations. Her excellence in this domain gives her visibility into the problem. That visibility creates obligation.

- Only she knows what she values here---the jobs-to-be-done framework reminds her that \"efficiency\" means different things in different contexts. For the director, it might mean margin. For Maya, it means access.

- Her identity, formed in voluntary networks and family, tells her: *this is not the kind of person I want to be*.

The three tools together give Maya something rare: **clarity without false certainty**.

She can see what\'s happening (ring), locate herself inside it (compass), and know who she is in response to it (internal framework). She still doesn\'t know what to do. But she knows the *right questions to ask*.

And that\'s what stewardship is: not having all the answers, but asking the right questions and acting faithfully within the constraints you actually face.

So let\'s build out those questions.

**Stewardship Principles (Not Rules)**

Here\'s the first hard truth about stewardship: **you can\'t tend everything**.

There are more broken systems, more misaligned hybrids, more places where the wrong habitat is eating the right one than you could fix in ten lifetimes. If you try to steward all of it, you\'ll steward none of it. You\'ll perform concern instead of making change.

So the first principle is **prioritization by actual influence**.

Ask: *Do I have real leverage here, or am I just spectating?*

Maya has leverage. She\'s inside the system. She sees the data. She has relationships with people who make decisions. She can\'t redesign healthcare policy, but she might be able to influence how *this* algorithm gets used in *this* network.

Someone reading about this story on Twitter does not have that leverage. They can rage, share, and signal, but they can\'t change the specific software Maya is dealing with. Their stewardship might be elsewhere---in their own workplace, their own neighborhood, their own craft.

The principle: **steward where you have actual influence, not where you have strong opinions**.

Second principle: **look for habitat misalignments**.

Most dysfunction in hybrids comes from one habitat\'s logic bleeding into another\'s territory:

- Market logic invading family (invoicing your kids for dinner)

- Family logic invading markets (nepotism, favoritism)

- Safety logic expanding too far (permanent emergency powers)

- Anarchy expecting to run critical infrastructure (no one in charge when the bridge needs repair)

When you see misalignment, you\'ve found a stewardship opportunity. Maya\'s algorithm problem is exactly this: market optimization logic (maximize throughput, minimize waste) imported into a safety commons space (treat people impartially, meet basic needs regardless of efficiency).

Ask: *Which habitat\'s logic is operating here? Is it the right one for this scale and purpose?*

Third principle: **your primary stewardship is YOUR excellence in YOUR domain**.

This sounds selfish until you remember the mechanism from Chapter 9: excellence generates surplus, surplus enables excess, excess funds discovery and generosity.

If you neglect your craft to fight every visible injustice, you\'ll have neither craft nor impact. You\'ll burn out on performance, not production.

But if you cultivate genuine excellence in your domain---whatever that is---you generate the resources (time, money, credibility, margin) that make sustainable stewardship possible.

Maya\'s excellence in operations is *why* she can see the problem. If she\'d spent the last six months rage-posting about healthcare inequity instead of learning the systems, she\'d have opinions but no leverage.

Ask: *Am I maintaining my own capacity to contribute, or am I burning down my surplus to perform concern?*

Fourth principle: **distinguish between problems you can affect and problems you can only witness**.

Some injustices are real, large, and entirely outside your sphere of influence. You can\'t fix them. You can witness them, lament them, vote about them, write about them. But you can\'t *steward* them in any meaningful sense.

Other problems are smaller, closer, and within your actual reach. These are your stewardship opportunities.

The brutal question: *Is this a problem I can actually affect, or am I performing concern to avoid the harder work of tending what\'s actually in front of me?*

Maya can\'t fix Medicaid reimbursement policy. She might be able to change how one hospital network uses one algorithm. That\'s not everything. But it\'s something.

Stewardship is about the **faithful use of actual power**, not the performance of desired power.

**Boundary Wisdom: Reform, Endure, or Exit?**

Now we come to the hardest set of questions.

When you\'re inside a broken hybrid, when you see the misalignment clearly, when you\'ve located yourself with the compass and the ring and you know what kind of person you want to be---you still have to decide:

Do I try to **reform** this system?\
Do I **endure** inside it while maintaining integrity?\
Or do I **exit**?

None of these is always right. All of them have costs. The discernment is in knowing which cost you can actually bear and which outcome you can actually live with.

Let\'s build the framework---not as rules, but as questions that help you think clearly.

**When to Try to Reform**

Consider reform when you have three things in alignment:

**1. Real influence.** You have relationships, credibility, or positional authority that gives you leverage. You\'re not shouting from outside the walls.

**2. Readiness in others.** Somebody with decision-making power is open to hearing the problem and willing to consider change. They may not agree with you yet, but they\'re not actively hostile.

**3. Sustainable cost.** The fight won\'t destroy your health, your family, your finances, or your capacity to do the excellent work that gives you credibility in the first place.

If you have all three, reform is worth attempting.

Maya might have all three. She has visibility into the data. Her director seems to respect her. She hasn\'t burned all her credibility yet. The cost of one more serious conversation---documented, specific, with proposed solutions---is manageable.

But here\'s the trap: **reform as performance**.

Sometimes we push for reform not because we think it will work, but because we need to feel like we tried. We give the prophetic speech, burn the relationships, accomplish nothing, and walk away feeling noble.

That\'s not stewardship. That\'s theater.

If you\'re going to try to reform, do it strategically:

- Document the problem clearly (in Maya\'s case: which zip codes, which patients, what outcomes).

- Propose specific, achievable changes (not \"fix healthcare\" but \"adjust the algorithm to stop penalizing Medicaid patients in rural zip codes\").

- Build alliances quietly before going loud.

- Know what you\'ll do if it fails.

Reform is an investment. Invest wisely.

**When to Endure**

Endurance sounds passive, but it\'s often the hardest and most strategic choice.

Consider enduring when:

**1. You can maintain integrity.** The system is broken, but participation doesn\'t require you to personally do harm or violate your core commitments. You can operate inside it with a clear conscience, even as you work to change it.

**2. Your presence prevents worse harm.** If you leave, someone less careful, less bothered, or more ruthless will take your seat. Your endurance is protective.

**3. Exit would abandon vulnerable people.** The patients, the clients, the students, the neighbors---the people the system is supposed to serve---would suffer more if you left than if you stayed.

Endurance is not resignation. It\'s **strategic patience paired with ongoing small resistance**.

Maya might choose endurance if her reform attempt fails. She could:

- Stay in her role and use her remaining influence to mitigate harm where she can.

- Document patterns for future advocacy or legal action.

- Mentor junior staff to see the problem she sees.

- Build relationships with community health advocates who might have leverage she doesn\'t.

Endurance is the long game. It\'s what you do when you can\'t win now but refuse to abandon the field.

The danger: **endurance as drift**.

If you stay without boundaries, if you stop resisting at all, if you let the system normalize what you once found intolerable, you\'re no longer enduring. You\'re just complicit.

Ask yourself periodically: *Am I enduring with integrity, or have I just given up and decided to collect a paycheck?*

**When to Exit**

Exit is the nuclear option. Sometimes it\'s the only faithful choice.

Consider exiting when:

**1. The system demands corruption as the price of participation.** You cannot do the job without violating your core commitments. There is no path to integrity inside.

**2. The cost to your health or family is unsustainable.** The system is breaking you in ways that will ripple out and harm the people you\'re actually responsible for. You cannot pour from an empty cup.

**3. Your presence enables harm rather than mitigating it.** By staying, you\'re providing cover, legitimacy, or skilled labor to something that should not continue. Your exit would be disruptive in a way that creates opportunity for change.

Exit is not failure. Sometimes it\'s the most faithful thing you can do.

But here\'s the discernment question: *Am I exiting because this is genuinely intolerable, or because it\'s hard and I want the relief?*

There\'s no shame in choosing your own wellbeing. But there\'s a difference between \"I cannot do this job with integrity\" and \"I don\'t want to do the hard work of enduring or reforming.\"

If Maya exits, she should do it clearly:

- Leave a paper trail for whoever comes next.

- Be specific about why (not \"toxic culture\" but \"this system penalizes vulnerable patients and I was asked to defend it\").

- Direct her energy toward a context where her skills can serve well.

Exit is not running away. It\'s **redirecting your stewardship to ground where you can actually tend something well**.

**The Framework Is Not a Formula**

You\'ll notice these aren\'t rules. They\'re questions.

There is no algorithm that tells you \"reform in situations A, B, C; endure in situations D, E, F; exit in situations G, H, I.\"

You\'re a person, not a machine. You have a life, a family, a set of obligations, a tolerance for conflict, a sense of calling. All of that matters.

The framework just helps you ask: *What am I actually choosing here, and why?*

And then you choose. And then you live with it.

**Long-Game Thinking**

Here\'s something families know instinctively that the rest of us forget at population scale:

**Some things only make sense if you\'re playing a very long game**.

Parents pour tens of thousands of dollars and tens of thousands of hours into raising children with no expectation of financial ROI. The \"return\" is measured in character, relationships, and the hope that this small person becomes someone you\'re proud to know.

That\'s a 25-year horizon. Minimum.

Nobody thinks that\'s weird at family scale. We all understand that love means investing in outcomes you won\'t fully see for decades.

But we forget that lesson the moment we step into population-scale systems. We demand quarterly results. We treat five-year plans as \"long-term.\" We make decisions based on what will happen in the next election cycle, the next earnings call, the next news cycle.

The systems that matter most---education, infrastructure, environmental stewardship, civic trust---all require thinking on timescales that outlive political careers and stock options.

How do you cultivate long-game thinking when everything around you is optimized for short-term extraction?

First: **recognize that you are already doing it in some areas of life**.

If you\'re raising kids, you\'re doing it.\
If you\'re planting trees, you\'re doing it.\
If you\'re contributing to a pension or saving for goals beyond next month, you\'re doing it.\
If you\'re maintaining friendships across decades, you\'re doing it.

The skill is not foreign to you. You just need to apply it more broadly.

Second: **ask the grandparent question**.

Before making a significant choice---in your work, your civic participation, your consumption, your craft---pause and ask:

*What world am I handing to the people who come after me?*

Not \"what will I personally experience before I die\" but \"what will my grandchildren inherit if people like me make choices like this one?\"

This is not sentimental. It\'s structural.

If you make decisions only for your own lifetime, you will systematically underinvest in things that mature slowly: soil health, institutional trust, apprenticeship in crafts, deep education, long-term infrastructure, the patient work of culture-building.

You\'ll strip-mine the surplus your grandparents built and leave nothing for your grandchildren.

But if you ask the grandparent question, you start making different choices:

- You invest in quality over speed.

- You build relationships that outlast transactions.

- You maintain systems even when you\'re not the immediate beneficiary.

- You resist short-term extraction when it degrades long-term capacity.

Third: **plant trees whose shade you\'ll never sit in**.

This is the phrase that names the posture.

You won\'t see the full outcome of most of your stewardship. The patients Maya helps today won\'t send her thank-you notes in 30 years. The students a teacher mentors won\'t loop back to credit them for every good choice. The engineer who designs a bridge to last a century won\'t be there when it\'s still standing.

You do it anyway.

Not because you\'re guaranteed success. Not because you\'ll get credit. But because this is what faithfulness looks like when you zoom out past your own lifetime.

The long game is not naïve. It\'s not \"everything will be fine.\" It\'s \"I will do what I can, where I am, with what I have, for outcomes I may never see.\"

That\'s stewardship.

**First Steps: Where to Start**

If you\'ve read this far, you have the complete toolkit:

- The ring (habitat map)

- The compass (location tool)

- The internal framework (vocation, value, identity, discipline)

- Stewardship principles (where to invest, how to discern)

- Long-game thinking (the posture)

You can see the systems you live inside. You can locate yourself. You know who you want to be.

So: what do you do Monday morning?

Here\'s the non-prescriptive answer: **you start where you actually are**.

Not where you wish you were. Not where you think you should be. Where you actually are, with the actual leverage you actually have.

**If you\'re just seeing the ring for the first time:**

Start with observation. Spend a week noticing which habitat you\'re in at different moments of your day:

- When you\'re at the kitchen table, you\'re in family/communism.

- When you\'re driving on public roads past fire stations, you\'re benefiting from the safety commons.

- When you\'re at work trading time for money or solving for customer value, you\'re in markets.

- When you\'re texting friends about dinner plans or helping someone move, you\'re in anarchy.

Just notice. No judgment. Just \"oh, I\'m switching habitats.\"

The awareness itself is the foundation.

**If you\'ve seen the ring and want to act:**

Start with YOUR excellence in YOUR domain.

Whatever you do for work, for craft, for contribution---do it 10% better. Not because someone\'s watching. Because excellence generates surplus, surplus enables excess, and excess is what you have to risk and give.

Neglect this and you\'ll have opinions but no impact. Tend this and you\'ll have the margin to steward well.

**If you\'re navigating a specific hybrid dilemma:**

Use the compass to locate yourself, then ask the boundary questions:

- Do I have real influence here? (If no, this might not be your stewardship)

- Is there a habitat misalignment I can name? (If yes, you\'ve found the lever)

- Should I try to reform, endure with integrity, or exit? (Use the discernment framework)

Then act. Not perfectly. Just faithfully.

**If you\'re feeling overwhelmed:**

Remember: you are not responsible for fixing everything.

You are responsible for faithfulness in your domain, with the people in front of you, using the leverage you actually have.

That\'s enough. When enough people do that, societies work.

**If you\'re wondering where to invest limited energy:**

Prioritize in this order:

1.  **Your family** - If this falls apart, nothing else you build will matter. Love them well.

2.  **Your craft** - Excellence here generates the surplus that funds everything else.

3.  **Your voluntary networks** - Friendships, community groups, the places where your character is formed and your identity chosen.

4.  **Your civic participation** - Vote, serve where you have actual influence, contribute to the commonwealth in ways that match your capacity.

Don\'t reverse the order. Don\'t skip steps. Don\'t neglect foundation to perform at the penthouse.

**The first step is always: tend what\'s in front of you with the excellence it deserves.**

**You Are the Kind of Person a Mixed Society Needs**

We\'ve come a long way from the slug line.

You now have a map of the territory (the ring), a tool for locating yourself inside it (the compass), an understanding of your own power and purpose (the internal framework from Chapter 9), and a set of stewardship principles for tending what you didn\'t design.

But here\'s what matters most:

**You are not a passive victim of broken systems.**

You are also not a lone hero who will fix everything through sheer force of will.

You are something more interesting and more powerful: **a steward with agency inside complex hybrids**.

The hospital Maya works in will not be perfected in her lifetime. Healthcare in America is a massive, tangled hybrid of markets, safety systems, family obligations, and voluntary networks. The misalignments run deep. The incentives are warped in places. The suffering is real.

But Maya is not helpless.

She can see clearly (ring + compass). She knows who she is (internal framework). She can ask the right questions (stewardship principles). She can choose faithfully (reform, endure, or exit with integrity). She can think long-game (grandparent question).

And so can you.

The society we\'ve been describing throughout this book---the one where all four habitats work in their proper places, where markets generate surplus that funds safety and enables voluntary generosity, where families raise children who can navigate complexity, where people show up for each other in ways no system can mandate---that society doesn\'t appear by accident.

It\'s built by people like you.

Not perfect people. Not people with all the answers. But people who:

- Cultivate excellence in their domain

- Maintain integrity in their relationships

- Think longer than the next quarter

- Ask which habitat belongs where

- Steward faithfully within actual constraints

- Plant trees whose shade they\'ll never sit in

When you do this work---when you become the kind of person who can operate well across the ring, who can maintain a moral center while swimming in population-scale systems, who can be partial where partiality is required and impartial where fairness matters---you become exactly what mixed societies need.

Not a reformer with a megaphone.\
Not a cynic who checks out.\
Not a utopian who expects perfection.

But a **faithful steward who tends the ground they\'re given**.

And here\'s the mechanism we keep circling back to: **when enough people do this, the hybrids start to work**.

Not because anyone mandated it from the top.\
Not because we found the perfect policy.\
But because the culture shifted, one person at a time, toward:

- Excellence over extraction

- Long game over quarterly hustle

- Stewardship over performance

- Integrity over expediency

That shift is already happening in pockets. You can see it in:

- The engineer who takes the pay cut to work on infrastructure that will outlast her career

- The teacher who invests extra hours in the struggling student no standardized test will ever measure

- The entrepreneur who turns down the predatory investor because some money costs too much

- The neighbor who shows up to the boring city council meeting because somebody has to care about stormwater management

- The parent who models long-game thinking by staying married through hard seasons and investing in kids with patience

These are not heroes. They\'re stewards.

And you can be one too.

Maya decided.

She drafted a memo. Three pages. Data-driven. Specific. She outlined how the algorithm was functioning, which patients it was affecting, what the measurable outcomes were, and three concrete proposals for adjustment.

She sent it to her director with a meeting request.

She didn\'t know if it would work. She knew it might cost her political capital. She knew it might accomplish nothing.

But she also knew: *This is what I can do. This is the leverage I have. This is who I choose to be inside this system.*

That\'s stewardship.

Not perfect. Just faithful.

And when enough people make choices like that---in hospitals and city halls and markets and living rooms---the ring starts to turn a little smoother.

The hybrids start to work.

The world becomes, incrementally, the kind of place you\'re proud to hand to your grandchildren.

Not because everything got fixed.

But because enough people tended their ground well.

*This is what you can build.*

*Not alone. But as one of many.*

*The epilogue will show you what becomes possible when we get it right.*
