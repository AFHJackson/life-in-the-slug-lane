## ⚠️ EXCEPTIONS - NEEDS USER REVIEW

### Exception 1: Line 510 - Framework resolve
**DASH:** "trade-offs that **no framework can** resolve for you"
**UNDERSCORE:** "trade-offs that **this framework will not perform** for you"  
**MARKDOWN:** "trade-offs that **this framework can** resolve for you"

**ISSUE:** Markdown appears to have a typo/error. It says "can resolve" when it should say "cannot" or match the underscore version. This is UNIQUE to markdown and differs from BOTH Word docs.

**RECOMMENDATION:** This looks like an error. Should likely be updated to underscore version: "this framework will not perform for you"

## Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Already Synced | ~16 changes |
| Needs Update | ~16 changes |
| Needs Review | 1 exception |

**Conclusion:** The markdown is approximately 50% synced with the underscore. The remaining updates can be applied, with one exception requiring user confirmation (the "framework can/cannot resolve" issue appears to be an error).
