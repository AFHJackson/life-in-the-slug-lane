> We all fall for stories that feel true---because they fit how we remember our lives, how our people expect us to think, and how our brains are wired. Generous, self-interested, socially minded, opportunistic, agreeable, disagreeable... pick your mix, your favorite explanation is waiting for you.\

> This book is about what happens when we finally notice the ring of systems we're already living in: capitalist markets that make surplus, socialist safety nets that keep us from falling apart, communist generosity at the family table, and anarchic order in our friendships and informal networks. Starting from a strange little "slug line" commute outside the Pentagon, it shows how seeing those systems working together might actually help us see them---and each other---more clearly.*
