# Prologue: The Ride That Shouldn't Have Worked

By the time the green Acura pulled up beside me, I had already resigned myself to the slow way home.

It was late enough that the evening light had given up and the office towers in Crystal City were doing most of the work. The wind coming down from the river had that particular D.C. talent for finding the gap between your collar and your neck. I was walking along the north edge of Crystal City toward the Pentagon bus stop, chewing on the mildly bitter taste of a missed ride home and an overlong workday.

The HOV lanes on I-395 had just opened up to everyone. That magical window for commuters in northern Virginia—three people in a vehicle and you fly past the endless lines of traffic headed south—was over. It was past the **witching hour**.

The rules are simple. During the restricted period, three people in the car gets you into the fast lane. After, the gates swing open and anyone can dive in. Before the witching hour, drivers cruise the commuter lots and bus stops hunting for extra passengers. After? No reason to bother.

At least, that's how the math is supposed to work.

I had dawdled just long enough at the office. I rushed down the elevator and out of the building to see the lines at 23rd were empty. I walked north toward the lines at 12th in vain hope—but those had dried up too. The slug lines had naturally dissipated. The buses at the Pentagon run late and would still get me home, but they'd take their time doing it, stopping at every well-meaning opportunity to remind me that punctuality is a virtue.

I had accepted my fate. I was going to earn this commute.

That's when the Acura eased over, window down.

"You know it's past the witching hour," the driver called out.

He said it like we were co-conspirators in some small, shared secret. It wasn't quite a question, not quite a warning. It was more like a diagnosis: *you're out here late, and you know what that means.*

I knew exactly what he meant. Once the HOV lanes open to general traffic, the incentives change. No one needs extra passengers. No more reason to pick up strangers.

"I'm headed to the Pentagon for the bus," I said, pointing down the street as if he couldn't see the massive five-sided building glowing a short distance away.

He shrugged.

"Don't worry about it. Jump in. I can get you to Tackett's Mill."

He must have seen it on the tell-tale, printed slug sign I carried as I walked toward my fate.

In that moment I did the quick calculus every slug in northern Virginia does dozens of times a year. The math is not written on any sign, but you learn it by heart: risk, reward, vibe check.

Was he sober? Did he sound sane? Did the car look roughly as if it had passed a recent inspection and had not been used for anything an FBI agent might ask about later? At that hour there were no five-star ratings on a phone screen, no app making soft chimes of reassurance. It was just two humans eyeing each other across a small gulf of uncertainty.

The car looked fine. The driver sounded normal.

I pulled the door handle and got in.

---

We drove off into traffic, joining the stream of red and white lights feeding toward the river. Overhead, the big electronic signs announced the HOV rules no longer applied. Traffic in the normal lanes flowed a little looser now that anyone was allowed to swim in the fast current.

For him, with the restriction lifted, there was no special advantage left in having me in the passenger seat.

Which is what made his offer so strange.

From a certain kind of economics—the kind we distill into neat diagrams and multiple-choice questions—what he was doing didn't make much sense.

Let's do the obvious math.

He was paying for gas. Adding a full-grown adult to the vehicle meant more weight, more fuel burned, more wear and tear on the car. I was not reimbursing him. There was no cash exchanged, no formal carpool, no government voucher to be redeemed.

He was paying in time, too. Picking up a stranger at the curb takes seconds, but seconds add up.

Socially, there was no point system, no punch card, no cosmic ledger where he could log this as a credit against future favors. We were strangers. The odds that we would recognize each other in a grocery store a year later were close to zero.

On paper, the whole move was irrational.

If you built your view of human behavior on the idealized creature beloved in basic economics—*homo economicus*, the perfectly self-interested rational actor—this interaction didn't fit. No direct benefit. No obvious indirect benefit. Just cost.

And yet, in the D.C. area, this kind of thing happens hundreds, maybe thousands of times a day.

To see why, we have to step back and look at the strange little ecosystem that produced this moment: the world of **slug lines**.

If you don't live in the orbit of the Pentagon, "slugging" sounds like something involving either baseball or garden pests. In reality, it's a form of guerrilla carpooling.

It started simply enough.

When the high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were first opened on I-95 and I-395, they came with a rule: three people in the car and you get to fly past the parking lot on the other side of the barrier. Drivers who faced an hour-plus commute began looking for ways to find those extra warm bodies.

Where do you find people who are definitely headed to the same place every morning?

At the bus stop.

Drivers started pulling over near commuter lots and Pentagon-bound stops, rolling down windows, and asking the most trustworthy-looking people in Washington, D.C.—which, if we're being honest, usually meant uniformed service members—"You going to the Pentagon?" If the answer was yes, everyone won. The driver got to qualify for the HOV lane. The passengers got a quieter, faster ride instead of a crowded bus.

This wasn't organized by a task force. There was no charter, no budget line, no branding campaign. It just happened, the way certain simple rules interacting with human ingenuity almost inevitably produce something new.

Then something predictable but important occurred.

Bus drivers started pulling up to their stops and finding their passengers missing. People were still at the stop—but not where the buses were supposed to pull in. Instead, they clustered a bit further down, near the spot where private cars would peel off the main road to scoop up riders.

These people looked like bus passengers. They had been waiting like bus passengers. But when the official bus opened its doors, they waved off the driver.

They weren't "real" passengers anymore. They were something else.

Driver slang for non-paying riders is "slugs"—from fake coins or tokens that trick vending machines and toll booths. The label stuck. Those improvised carpoolers, willing to wait for a faster free ride instead of a slower paid one, became *slugs*.

Over time, the system evolved.

Unwritten rules hardened into reliable habits. Certain lots developed clearly understood queues for specific destinations: this line is for the Pentagon, that one for L'Enfant Plaza, that one for the Navy Yard or State Department. Without anyone issuing a memo, people learned how many riders a particular off-ramp could realistically support.

A complete stranger could walk up to a slug line for the first time, watch for five minutes, and figure out what to do. Later, signs, websites, and forums emerged to facilitate this adjacent ecosystem—but not initially. The pieces were there. Human phenomena put them to use.

There are no uniforms, no official badges, no ticket machines. There is no central dispatcher, no posted schedule. If a line gets too long and drivers for that destination are scarce, people quietly adjust their plans.

The whole thing looks, from a distance, remarkably like a formal transportation system. It moves thousands of people each day. It has norms, expectations, and feedback loops. It can respond to changes in traffic, policy, and demand.

But there is no "slug line authority."

No one is in charge.

As an engineering challenge, slugging is fascinating. As a social phenomenon, it's even more interesting.

Consider the ingredients that make it possible.

First, there is **public infrastructure**: the highway itself, built and maintained with tax dollars; the HOV lanes with their rules; the commuter lots and bus stops that provide natural gathering points.

Second, there is **private property and individual incentive**: the cars, bought and maintained by drivers who want to save time and fuel; the commuters, each with a personal schedule, a job, a family rhythm they are trying to protect.

Third, there is **trust and social norm**: the feeling that it is acceptable to get into a stranger's car; the expectation that drivers will take you where they said they would; the unspoken rule that you don't pay cash, you don't hassle the driver, you don't make things weird.

Fourth, there is something like **anarchy**, in the original sense of the word: no formal ruler. Slugging is voluntary, self-organizing, and astonishingly robust given its lack of official structure.

---

Try to drop this into the categories we usually argue about, and it starts misbehaving.

Is slugging capitalist? No one is forced to participate. Everyone is pursuing their own self-interest: a faster commute, a cheaper trip, a more predictable schedule. There is private property, voluntary exchange, and a kind of informal marketplace of rides.

Is slugging socialist? It emerges from a backbone of shared public investment. The highways, ramps, and lots are financed collectively. The HOV incentive is a policy decision: a deliberate choice to trade lane space for fewer cars and faster trips for high-occupancy vehicles.

Is slugging anarchic? There is no boss, no central committee, no formal enforcement. People queue and ride based on a web of customs and habits they could, in theory, ignore without fear of written penalty. Yet by and large, they don't.

Is slugging familial, tribal, charitable? Strangers often go out of their way to help. Riders share tips and unwritten rules. Drivers will sometimes take small detours to drop someone closer to home. There is a quiet ethic of looking out for one another during snowstorms, emergencies, or breakdowns.

If you are very committed to one ideology, you can squint hard and claim slugging as a victory for your team. You can focus on the voluntarism and call it capitalism in action, or focus on the public infrastructure and call it proof that socialism works. You can point to the self-organization and invoke anarchy, or highlight the sense of community and call it a triumph of mutual aid.

But the truth is less satisfying to partisans and more interesting to everyone else.

Slugging is not any one of these things.

It is all of them at once.

It is public and private, selfish and generous, structured and improvised. It relies on the state to set broad conditions, on markets to make cars available and gas worth saving, on social trust to make stepping into a stranger's sedan feel normal, and on emergent order to keep thousands of daily interactions from dissolving into chaos.

In other words, it is a **system of systems**.

Sitting in the passenger seat that night, sliding past the red glow of slower lanes, I found my attention drifting away from small talk and toward that driver's decision.

He had picked me up **after** the witching hour.

He had already gotten what the policy promised him: unrestricted access to the fast lane. I was now, in purely instrumental terms, unnecessary cargo. Yet he still rolled down his window and invited me in.

Why?

Maybe he just wanted the company. Maybe he was in the habit and didn't think much about it. Maybe he remembered what it felt like to be the guy stuck at the bus stop.

The truth is, I don't know his reasons.

What I do know is that his simple, slightly irrational act forced a crack in the way I had been taught to think about social and economic systems.

Like most of us, I had absorbed a mental map in which capitalism, socialism, communism, and anarchy were rival teams on a straight line that ran from "Left" to "Right." Each team came with a starter pack of heroes and villains, historical examples to celebrate or condemn, and standard talking points.

On that map, the first duty of a responsible grown-up was to pick a side.

If you saw the creative power of markets, you learned to flinch at the word "socialism." If you were moved by stories of solidarity and shared sacrifice, you learned to distrust "capitalism." If you admired rugged individualism, you grew suspicious of the state. If you feared chaos, you grew suspicious of anything labeled "anarchy."

In that framework, systems compete for the right to run everything.

Capitalism and socialism are presented as total packages. Communism is not simply a proposal for how a small group might share resources; it's a claim about how entire nations, even humanity itself, should be organized. Anarchy is not simply a description of how some informal groups work well without formal rulers; it's a terrifying picture of society with no rules at all.

You are supposed to choose one as the answer to the question, "How should we live together?" and then spend the rest of your political life defending that choice.

Yet here I was, in a car that only existed because all of those systems were entangled.

---

The ride worked because the state had paved highways, public safety officers exist, and written HOV rules are enforced. It worked because car manufacturers had competed to build vehicles, people had bought them in a market and were employing them to suit their individual goals and values. It worked because strangers trusted one another enough to get in and drive together. It worked because informal norms had emerged and been honored.

No single ideology could claim it. No single system could have produced it alone.

And once I saw that on my commute, I started seeing it everywhere.

I saw it at home, where we raised children in a tiny world built on radically unequal giving and receiving. I saw it whenever a neighbor called 911 and a whole apparatus of publicly funded safety swung into motion. I saw it in grocery stores and gas stations and workplaces, where prices and paychecks and competition shaped decisions. I saw it in the way friends organized help when someone got sick, or lost a job, or had their house flood.

We weren't living under a single system. We were living inside a layered, overlapping **system of systems**.

The more I looked, the more one suspicion grew: maybe the problem is not that we picked the wrong team on that ideological line.

Maybe the problem is the line itself.

---

We need to redraw the map.

Is it possible that many of the systems we treat as mortal enemies—communism, socialism, capitalism, and anarchy—are each appropriate at specific *scales* of human life? They are not competitors in a winner-take-all tournament. They are different tools for different jobs.

At the scale of the family, something like "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need" is not a dystopian slogan. It's a pretty good description of what love looks like around a kitchen table.

At the scale of municipalities, public safety and national defense, something like socialism—collectively funded, universally available services—has turned out to be a remarkably effective way to make sure fires get put out, ambulances show up, and borders are defended, regardless of your income.

At the scale of a whole society's production and exchange, capitalism has proven to be a powerful engine for discovering and generating what people value, rewarding divergence and creativity, and generating the immense surpluses that make everything else possible.

And in the space of friendships and informal networks, something like positive anarchy—voluntary cooperation that self-organizes into surprisingly complex patterns—shows up all the time, from hobby groups to open-source software projects to those improvised rescue efforts that materialize after a storm.

If that's even roughly true, then the central question is not, "Which system should win?"

The central question is, **"At what scale does each system belong—and how do we help them work together instead of tearing each other apart?"**

---

The ride that shouldn't have worked—the driver who picked me up after the witching hour, in a car made by a private company, on a public road, in a self-organized queue of strangers—was my first clear glimpse of that question.

To follow it, we're going to have to do two things.

First, we'll have to look carefully at the different scales of human life you move through every day, from family to friendships to markets to states, and notice how your instincts change as you cross those boundaries.

Second, we'll have to ask how we ended up with a political and economic map that mostly ignores those scales, and instead invites us to shout across a flat line from "Left" to "Right."

The next chapter begins at a different table—with a four-year-old, a stack of performance charts, and a very bad idea about how to run a family.

It's a slightly ridiculous story. But like that ride home from Crystal City, it hides a serious question:

If we already live inside a system of systems, why are we still arguing as if only one of them is allowed to be real?
