- All original chapter markdown files (00-14)
- Original Word documents (.docx)
- `first-draft.md` - Combined original draft

2. **Content Strategy Development** - These drafts informed the creation of:
   - Book DNA Writing Guide
   - Chapter outlines
   - Style guidelines
   - Target audience profile

3. **Framework Validation** - Joshua's original thinking and framework development preserved here
