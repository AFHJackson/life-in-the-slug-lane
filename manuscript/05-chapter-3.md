**Chapter 3 -- The First Little Commune**

By the time you're old enough to spell **economy**, you've already lived inside one.

It smells like mac and cheese, sounds like siblings arguing over who got more fries, and runs on a rule so simple we almost never say it out loud: the grown‑ups give what they can, the kids take what they need, and nobody sends anyone an invoice.

Picture a very ordinary dinner.

One child is still in soccer cleats, inhaling food like the game is still going. Another is staring at a math worksheet, fork hovering, appetite dulled by frustration. A toddler is half‑eating and half‑redecorating their high chair with pasta sauce. A parent gets up three times---more water, more napkins, the missing fork---because they can't quite bring themselves to sit while someone else needs something.

There is nothing balanced about that table.

The person who cooked didn't charge the others a fee. The one who went to work that day didn't take a larger portion of the food because they "earned" more. Whatever they did out there in the world---writing code, repairing planes, running a register, managing a team---was a market-scale trade of ability for income. But the paycheck that came home is not sliced at the table according to who brought how much in. The toddler will contribute absolutely nothing measurable to the household economy for years and will still consume more than their share of attention, time, and detergent.

If an economist from Mars dropped in with a clipboard, they might label your home as a failing enterprise. Costs wildly exceed revenues. The most expensive members generate no income. The leadership works constantly and never sends a bill.

But that same Martian, if they listened for just a moment, might pick up a deeper pattern. People at this table are not asking, "What's in it for me?" They are asking, "What do they need, and what can I give?"

From each according to their ability. To each according to their need.

You don't hear that line at the dinner table, but you see it lived there all the time.

Before anyone reads about communism in a history book or hears it praised or cursed on television, they have already spent years inside a small, messy, utterly non‑ideological version of it. The first little commune is not in a manifesto. It's in the kitchen.

In the last chapter, we broke the political spectrum's straight line. We saw how the words that fill our arguments---communism, socialism, capitalism, anarchy---flatten into tribal jerseys on a single left/right axis. Then we pivoted away from the shouting matches and ended at home: at the family table, the first "habitat" where one of these systems actually makes sense.

Now we can finally name what we've been quietly doing all along.

**Naming What We Already Do**

Communism, in most people's minds, comes pre‑loaded with a whole dystopian slideshow: gray apartments, long breadlines, stern leaders on balconies, secret police in the background. It's a word with a lot of baggage.

So when I say that family life runs on a kind of communism, I am **not** baptizing any of those regimes. I'm backing up to the core idea inside the slogan: *from each according to their ability, to each according to their need*---and noticing that, at family scale, that principle is not a disaster. It is the default.

In a healthy home, the strong carry the weak as a matter of course.

Babies do not "earn" midnight feedings. Elderly parents do not "qualify" for rides to the doctor. A child with special needs will draw down more money, more time, more emotional energy than their siblings. The ledger is wildly uneven.

Yet most of us would be horrified at a family that tried to make it perfectly even.

We instinctively judge a parent who tells their teenager, "I calculated how much you cost us last year, so you owe us \$14,372 plus interest." We recoil from the sibling who refuses to visit their sick brother because "I already did my part during his last surgery." We don't call that responsible. We call it cruel.

We expect family members to contribute what they can and to receive what they need, with huge allowances for weakness, immaturity, and crisis. We expect that unevenness *on purpose*.

That is the logic at the heart of the slogan. Family doesn't know it's quoting Marx, but it is living out his most famous sentence every day---long before anyone argues about who misapplied it at national scale.

And this is the first important move in our map: to see that the word "communism" has a **home habitat** where its core idea makes moral, emotional, and practical sense.

The family is that habitat.

**Why the Little Commune Works**

If this rule works so well around the kitchen table, why does it blow up so spectacularly when someone tries to run whole countries with it?

To answer that, we need to see what's hiding under the surface of that dinner scene---the invisible conditions that make "from each / to each" not just tolerable, but beautiful.

Part of what's hiding there is invisible in a different way. The food on the table, the lights that stay on, the rent or mortgage that gets paid---those usually come from paychecks earned out in the market habitat, where people specialize, trade, and turn effort into money. But once those resources cross the threshold of the front door, the family stops treating them as individual trophies and starts treating them as a common pool. The outside world may run on prices; the inside of the home runs on promise.

**1. Thick Love and Attachment**

The first ingredient is obvious but easy to skip over because we're used to it: love.

The adults at that table don't serve the children because of a spreadsheet. They serve them because something in them is wired to care. They are attached to these specific humans. Their joys and pains have become interwoven.

When the baby cries at 2 a.m., no one consults a compensation chart. A parent staggers down the hall because they can't not. The cost is real, but the love is deeper.

Trying to run a national economy on "from each / to each" without that thick web of attachment is like trying to run a power grid on static electricity from sweaters. There just isn't enough current.

**2. Asymmetry of Responsibility**

Second, there's a built‑in asymmetry.

At the table, not everyone is equally responsible for making dinner happen. The toddler has no duty to contribute money to the grocery budget. The eight‑year‑old may have a chore or two, but no one expects them to carry the mortgage. The responsibility to provide leans heavily on the adults.

We recognize this asymmetry as just.

The adults chose to bring these children into the world. They have power the children don't. They understand how the world works in a way the children can't yet. With greater power and knowledge comes greater responsibility, so we expect the parents to give more.

When a parent insists that a ten‑year‑old should be "pulling their own weight" in the same way, we don't call that equality. We call it neglect.

**3. Knowledge and Intimacy**

Third, family members are close enough to know what each person actually needs.

You can look at your child and see that something is wrong before they can articulate it. You can tell from a slammed door that the problem is not, in fact, the door. You know that one kid eats more on practice days and that another needs quiet before they can talk.

In other words, you have **local knowledge**---detailed, dynamic, emotionally charged information that doesn't fit on a form. As the economist Friedrich Hayek pointed out, large systems usually can't see this kind of detail. But inside a home, the details are the whole point.

"From each / to each" is safer when the people doing the giving actually understand the situation of the people doing the receiving. You don't need a census to discover who in your household had a terrible day.

**4. Long Time Horizons**

Fourth, the family plays a very long game.

Companies answer to quarterly earnings reports. Markets push firms to specialize, to trade, to generate enough surplus that the lights can stay on and paychecks can clear. Governments answer to election cycles and budgets. Families answer to decades.

You spend a small fortune and thousands of hours raising a child with no financial payback at all for at least eighteen years, and often never in any direct sense. Whether that "fortune" is a high salary or a fragile paycheck stretched to the limit, it tends to fall, in rough terms, into three piles in your mind: what we absolutely have to cover just to keep going, what we'd really like if we can swing it, and what feels like "more than we strictly need" --- the extra gift, the trip, the risky experiment. Economists might call those necessity, surplus, and excess. Inside the family, though, those piles stop being personal scoreboards. They become shared resources that we aim, as best we can, at the people who need them most. If you do get money back later, it usually shows up in awkward arguments about whether your grown kids are allowed to pick up the check.

In a family, the "return on investment" is measured in character, relationship, and shared memory more than in dollars. You don't expect a toddler to balance the books. You expect them to become someone you love watching grow.

This long time horizon makes uneven giving sustainable. A parent can pour themselves out for years because they are not measuring success in the next six months. They are aiming at launch: the day this small person can stand on their own.

**5. A Thick "We"**

Finally, there is a thick sense of *we*.

Families, however they're shaped, are not just a pile of individuals who happen to share a refrigerator. They share a name, a history, a set of inside jokes. They know the stories that begin, "Remember the time when...?"

That "we" gives meaning to sacrifice.

When a parent says, "We're going to have to cut back this year," they don't mean "you lose, I win." They mean the family as a whole is facing something together. When an older sibling quietly takes a less expensive path so that a younger one can attend a particular school, they are leaning on that shared identity.

The point is not that families are perfect. Many fail at all of this. The point is that when family works **well**, it works because it has these five ingredients: thick love, asymmetric responsibility, intimate knowledge, long time horizons, and a strong sense of "we."

Put those together and "from each according to ability, to each according to need" doesn't look like a utopian slogan. It looks like Tuesday night.

**When the Commune Breaks at Home**

Of course, families don't always work well. Even at the right scale, the little commune can fail in at least two directions.

On one side, families can become **too transactional**.

Here, every kindness is a loan, and every gift comes with a reminder. Children grow up hearing that they are expensive, that they "owe" their parents success, that affection is conditional on performance.

It's like living inside a quarterly review.

Imagine a family meeting where the parents hand out printed scorecards: "Q2 Report on Household Contribution." One child has exceeded expectations in sports but underperformed in grades. Another has strong academics but poor attitude metrics. Bonuses and affection will be adjusted accordingly.

We recognize this as a horror story, not a healthy home. The very thought of treating a child's worth as a performance review offends our sense of what family is supposed to be.

On the other side, families can become **too smothering**.

These are the families where the shared "we" leaves no space for "I." Every decision must be collective. Every deviation feels like betrayal. Parents, or sometimes grandparents, see any attempt at independence as a personal rejection.

In this version, "from each / to each" becomes an excuse for endless intrusion. Because everyone belongs to everyone, no one is allowed boundaries. Privacy is selfish. Personal aspirations that pull away from the family are greeted with emotional blackmail: *After all we've done for you...*

The tragedy here is that the very strengths of family---closeness, sacrifice, shared identity---get twisted into tools of control.

In both failure modes, the core idea is distorted. Either the home is run like a cold little firm, or it is run like a warm little prison.

The point is not to romanticize family life. It is to see that even in its proper habitat, family‑scale communism needs something deeper guiding it: a sense of right and wrong that can critique both neglect and smothering.

Call it moral law, conscience, covenant, or simply "what we all know is supposed to happen here." Whatever name you give it, families rely on a standard beyond "from each / to each" to tell them *how* to apply that principle.

And that, again, is the pattern we'll keep running into: no system runs safely just because its slogan sounds noble.

**The Trouble with One Big Family**

If "from each / to each" works so well in the small, it's tempting to ask: why not scale it up?

Why not treat an entire nation as one big household? Why not call citizens "our children" and talk about "the family of the nation" as if everyone shared the same kitchen table?

Politicians love this language. So do some CEOs. "We're a family here" is a comforting slogan in both speeches and staff meetings. It promises loyalty, care, and a sense of belonging that most institutions struggle to provide.

But as soon as we try to take the family operating system and install it at national or corporate scale, strange things start to happen.

**Paternalism and Infantilization**

When leaders cast an entire population as their children, they tend to cast themselves as the parents.

That might sound harmless, even cozy. Who doesn't want someone looking out for them? The trouble is that parents make decisions **for** their children, not **with** them. They restrict information "for their own good." They limit choices, set bedtimes, confiscate dangerous toys.

Children actually need this. Citizens do not.

When a government or a company leans too hard into the "we're one big family" metaphor, it often starts treating adults as oversized kids: too fragile for certain ideas, too irresponsible for certain freedoms, too immature to be trusted with their own lives. Dissent becomes disobedience. Criticism becomes disrespect.

The warmth of the metaphor hides a grab for authority.

**Nepotism and Dynasties**

Family logic also tends to pull decision‑making inward.

If you are convinced that the best people to trust are "your own," it's a short step from family loyalty to nepotism. Jobs go to cousins. Contracts go to in‑laws. Regulatory decisions are quietly influenced by who shows up at Thanksgiving.

At that point, the generous partiality that is morally required inside the home becomes corruption outside it.

We expect parents to favor their children over strangers. We do **not** expect a hiring manager to favor their nephew over a more qualified applicant just because they share genes. We do **not** expect a judge to look at a defendant and see a last name instead of a case.

When they do, we don't call that communism or capitalism. We call it unfair.

**Unfairness to Outsiders**

Finally, the "one big family" story usually has a quiet asterisk.

There is almost always a boundary between those who really count as family and those who don't. Sometimes it's literal: a ruling clan or dynasty whose bloodlines matter more than any constitution. Sometimes it's tribal, ethnic, religious, or partisan.

The result is that resources, protection, and opportunities flow first to "our people," and only later, if at all, to everyone else. The family feeling becomes a shield---for some---and a wall---for others.

What began as a promise of solidarity turns into a justification for favoritism.

Again, the problem is not that family language is always bad. It can remind leaders that they bear a special duty of care. But when the metaphor becomes the model---when a nation really tries to behave like a single home---the partial love that makes family beautiful starts to tear public life apart.

**When the Family Grows Teeth**

So far we've talked about parents, kids, and small households. But family logic doesn't stop at the front door.

Extend it out a few rings and you get extended families, clans, and tribes---groups bound by blood, marriage, or long memory. These larger families carry many of the same strengths as the household: mutual aid, loyalty, a sense of belonging.

They also carry the same temptations, now enhanced by numbers.

A clan can protect its own fiercely. It can also use family loyalty as a reason to break rules, bend laws, and close ranks when someone on the inside harms someone on the outside.

Police chiefs, judges, procurement officers, and mayors are all human. They all have people they call "my own." The pull to quietly favor those people never goes away.

At small scale, that pull is exactly what you want. You *should* care more about your child's scraped knee than about a stranger's. You *should* feel a heavier weight of responsibility toward your aging parent than toward a random name in a phone book.

But when the same pull operates inside public office, things twist.

The knee that gets treated first in the emergency room is the one with a relative in the system. The contract goes to the company whose owner married into the right family. The law is enforced with one level of seriousness in one neighborhood and a very different level in another.

Tribalism is family feeling with teeth.

Again, the point is not that tribes are evil. Humans are tribal animals. We form tight groups and we always will. The point is that **the more power a tribe has over strangers, the more dangerous it becomes when it acts like a household.**

Inside the home, partiality is love. Outside, in the wrong places, it becomes injustice.

**Partial Love, Impartial Law**

This brings us to a crucial distinction that will keep showing up in this book: the difference between **special duties** and **general duties**.

Most moral traditions, religious or secular, agree that you have special obligations to some people.

You owe more to your children than to strangers. You owe more to your spouse than to a coworker. You owe more to the elderly relative in your care than to a nameless crowd on the news.

This is not favoritism. It is fidelity.

At the same time, you have general duties toward everyone: you must not lie to them, steal from them, exploit them, or shrug at their basic human dignity just because they are not "yours."

Put differently:

- Inside the home, you are **required** to be partial. Failing to prioritize your own family is a moral failure.

- Outside the home, in certain roles, you are **required** to be impartial. Failing to treat people fairly because they are not your family is also a moral failure.

A judge with a child in their courtroom has to lean on general duty over special duty. A fire chief whose brother's house is burning cannot reorder the city's emergency response plan to prioritize that address. A police officer cannot look the other way when a cousin breaks the law.

We feel the tension of this instinctively.

On the one hand, we admire people who sacrifice for their families. On the other, we get angry when "who you know" decides who gets justice, protection, or opportunity.

So we build systems that try to honor both truths.

We carve out a sphere---home, kin, close friendship---where partiality is not just allowed but celebrated. And we carve out other spheres---courts, emergency services, public institutions---where we demand the opposite: rules that apply the same way to everyone, regardless of their last name.

Moral law, however you understand it, sits above both. It says to the family, "You **must** care for your own." It says to the judge, "You **must not** favor your own." The same human being can inhabit both commands, at different times, in different roles.

This is where our map begins to widen.

If the family is the first little commune---partial, intimate, unequal on purpose---then something else must exist alongside it: systems built for strangers, systems where the default setting is not "to each according to need" inside a small circle of love, but something colder and fairer.

We actually want both.

We want homes that run on sacrificial love, not on invoices. And we want public systems that run on justice, not on whether somebody loves you.

To get there, we need more than one operating system.

**What the Commune Can't Do**

Whatever picture you have of the ideal family---traditional, blended, chosen---the small commune around the table has hard limits. It can turn paychecks into groceries, rent, and school supplies, but it cannot manufacture those paychecks or goods out of thin air.

No matter how loving, a family cannot organize a city‑wide fire response.

They can buy a fire extinguisher. They can talk through an escape plan. They can, in an emergency, run next door and bang on a neighbor's door. But they cannot keep trucks fueled, crews trained, hydrants maintained, and dispatch centers staffed for thousands of people.

They can't coordinate traffic at rush hour so that ambulances can get through. They can't build and maintain the kind of roads where those ambulances don't lose their axles on the way.

They can't create neutral rules to resolve a dispute between two strangers who share no history and no affection.

They can't ensure that the person who lives alone, has no relatives, and is not good at making friends is still protected when things go wrong.

At some point, the little commune hits the edge of its competence.

You can feel this in miniature in any city.

Think back to the slug‑line system outside the Pentagon in the Prologue---the ride that shouldn't have worked.

On one level, it felt like an odd, emergent friendship circle: strangers lining up at unofficial spots, drivers and riders trusting each other enough to share a commute without contracts or apps. It looked a little like anarchy in the best sense: voluntary cooperation producing order.

But under that fragile, informal layer sat something else.

The roads those cars used were maintained by taxes. The traffic signals were installed by engineers. The HOV lanes were enforced by officers. The whole scene unfolded in a space where public safety systems---police, fire, rescue---were standing by, funded by everyone for the sake of anyone.

Underneath that, there was something quieter still: paychecks earned in offices and shops and hangars, car payments made, fuel bought, insurance paid. Families and firms had gone out into the market habitat, traded their abilities for income, and turned income into vehicles, gas, and smartphones. The little anarchy of the slug line and the quiet communism of the family both floated on top of that river of earned surplus.

The parent in the green sedan who grabbed an extra rider from the slug line was not just trusting the goodness of strangers. They were trusting an infrastructure of rules, uniforms, radios, and emergency responses that would kick in if anything went wrong.

Their family commune at home and their little emergent anarchy in the slug line both floated on a deeper sea: systems built to protect people *whether or not anyone loves them personally*.

Family can't do that.

It shouldn't try.

The same is true in a fire.

When flames are coming through the roof at three in the morning, you do not want the fire chief to ask whether anyone inside is "one of ours." You don't want your house's chances to depend on how many friends you have, how compelling your story sounds on social media, or whether a cousin works at the station.

You want sirens, hoses, training, and a dispatch system that treats your address exactly like everyone else's.

You want a service that is collectively funded, always on call, and pointed at **everyone**---families, loners, visitors, people you like, and people you don't.

And here's the twist: the people jumping off that truck almost certainly went home, after their shift, to some version of a little commune like yours.

In the morning, they live inside "from each / to each" at their own kitchen tables. By afternoon, they climb into uniforms and step into a different operating system: one where partial love is set aside so impartial protection can take over.

The world works, when it works, because we let those systems coexist instead of forcing one to swallow the others.

We need families that run on sacrificial, uneven, intimate care. We need public institutions that treat strangers fairly and show up for everyone, not just for the people someone already loves personally. And we need the humbler, less sentimental work of markets, where people specialize, trade, and generate enough surplus and even a little excess to pay for groceries, mortgages, fire trucks, pensions, and everything else. A family's moral worth doesn't rise and fall with its income, but the money that does come in usually owes something to that market habitat. What makes home home is that, once those resources arrive, we stop asking who earned how much and start asking who needs what.

So if the family is the first little commune, what do we call this other system that sends out fire trucks, staffs emergency rooms, and stands between us and chaos---no matter who we are?

What makes it work when it stays in its proper place?

And what happens when *it* tries to run everything?

That's where we go next.
