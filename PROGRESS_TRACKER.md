## SESSION LOG

### Session 1: January 10, 2026
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Participants:** Joshua + Claude.ai Project

**Accomplished:**
- Clarified project vision and approach
- Defined three-role structure (Joshua, Claude.ai, VS Code agents)
- Confirmed target audience strategy (G+T focus)
- Researched Working Geniuses framework
- Created foundational documents:
  - Custom Instructions
  - README.md
  - WORKING_GENIUSES_RESEARCH.md
  - PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (this document)

**Decisions Made:**
- Use full comprehensive approach (not minimal starter)
- Build in dependency order (foundations first)
- Target Galvanizing + Tenacity readers exclusively
- Use Opus for structure, Sonnet for content, Opus for final review

**Next Session Plan:**
- Complete foundation documents (Decision Log, Roadmap, etc.)
- Create VS Code setup guide
- Begin VS Code environment configuration

**Blockers:** None

## RISK REGISTER

### Active Risks

**Risk:** Token limits interrupt multi-session work  
**Mitigation:** Work in dependency-ordered chunks, clear session boundaries  
**Status:** 🟢 Managed

**Risk:** Knowledge graph becomes too complex to maintain  
**Mitigation:** Start simple, add complexity only as needed  
**Status:** 🟡 Monitoring

**Risk:** Content appeals to I+D instead of G+T  
**Mitigation:** Every decision filtered through G+T lens, regular audience checks  
**Status:** 🟢 Managed

**Risk:** Joshua loses motivation during execution phases  
**Mitigation:** Clear progress tracking, celebrate milestones, maintain structure  
**Status:** 🟡 Monitoring

---

## NEXT ACTIONS (Immediate)

**For Joshua:**
1. Review foundation documents created so far
2. Approve approach or suggest adjustments
3. Prepare to set up new Claude.ai project
4. Prepare to set up VS Code environment

**For Claude.ai Project:**
1. Complete remaining foundation documents
2. Create VS Code setup guide
3. Create workflow protocols
4. Create agent handoff procedures

**For VS Code Agents:**
- Awaiting environment setup (no tasks yet)

---

## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

**What's Working:**
- Dependency-ordered approach prevents skipping critical steps
- G+T focus provides clear content decision filter
- Three-role division (Joshua, Claude.ai, VS Code) clarifies responsibilities

**What Needs Attention:**
- Need to test entity extraction approach before committing to full workflow
- VS Code agent handoff protocol needs careful design (Opus ↔ Sonnet transitions)

**Questions to Resolve:**
- What existing content should be migrated wholesale vs. regenerated?
- How granular should entity extraction be?
- What's the minimum viable knowledge graph for first content generation?
