## SESSION LOG

### Session 1: January 10, 2026
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Participants:** Joshua + Claude.ai Project

**Accomplished:**
- Clarified project vision and approach
- Defined three-role structure (Joshua, Claude.ai, VS Code agents)
- Confirmed target audience strategy (G+T focus)
- Researched Working Geniuses framework
- Created foundational documents:
  - Custom Instructions
  - README.md
  - WORKING_GENIUSES_RESEARCH.md
  - PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (this document)

**Decisions Made:**
- Use full comprehensive approach (not minimal starter)
- Build in dependency order (foundations first)
- Target Galvanizing + Tenacity readers exclusively
- Use Opus for structure, Sonnet for content, Opus for final review

**Next Session Plan:**
- Complete foundation documents (Decision Log, Roadmap, etc.)
- Create VS Code setup guide
- Begin VS Code environment configuration

**Blockers:** None

---

### Session 2-5: January 10-18, 2026
**Focus:** Foundation and Architecture completion

**Accomplished:**
- Entity extraction from all existing chapters
- Knowledge graph and entity database built
- Argument spine validated
- Delta extraction system created
- Chapter outlines created for all 13 sections

---

### Session 6: January 19, 2026
**Focus:** I→D→G Voice Architecture Migration

**Accomplished:**
- Major voice pivot: G+T → I→D→G (Decision D008)
- Converted all 13 chapter outlines to I→D→G format
- Archived all G+T era materials:
  - 13 old chapter outlines → `editorial/outlines/archive/`
  - G+T reference docs → `reference/archive/`
  - 6 OPUS/SONNET drafts → `manuscript/drafts/archived-g-t/`
- Updated DECISION_LOG.md, README.md, handoff documents
- Created archive READMEs explaining superseded content

**Decisions Made:**
- D008: Pivot from G+T to I→D→G voice architecture
- Joshua's authentic authority is I+D (cannot prescribe T-domain actions)
- New structure: Invention Opening → Discernment Middle → Galvanizing Close

**Next Session Plan:**
- Begin Phase 2 content generation
- Generate first chapter using I→D→G outlines

**Blockers:** None

## RISK REGISTER

### Active Risks

**Risk:** Token limits interrupt multi-session work  
**Mitigation:** Work in dependency-ordered chunks, clear session boundaries  
**Status:** 🟢 Managed

**Risk:** Knowledge graph becomes too complex to maintain  
**Mitigation:** Start simple, add complexity only as needed  
**Status:** 🟡 Monitoring

**Risk:** Content appeals to I+D instead of G+T  
**Mitigation:** Every decision filtered through G+T lens, regular audience checks  
**Status:** 🟢 Managed

**Risk:** Joshua loses motivation during execution phases  
**Mitigation:** Clear progress tracking, celebrate milestones, maintain structure  
**Status:** 🟡 Monitoring

---

## NEXT ACTIONS (Immediate)

**For Joshua:**
1. Review I→D→G outlines in `editorial/outlines/`
2. Select starting chapter for content generation
3. Provide any additional insights or examples needed

**For Content Generation (Sonnet):**
1. Use `HANDOFF_TO_SONNET_CONTENT_GENERATION.md` as guide
2. Follow I→D→G voice architecture from `BOOK_DNA_WRITING_GUIDE.md`
3. Generate chapter drafts using `-IDG.md` outlines
4. Apply PHASE structure: Invention (10-15%) → Discernment (60-70%) → Galvanizing (15-25%)

**For Final Review (Opus):**
- Awaiting content generation completion

---

## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

**What's Working:**
- I→D→G voice architecture aligns with Joshua's authentic authority
- Dependency-ordered approach prevented building on unstable foundations
- Archive structure preserves history while keeping active workspace clean

**What Needs Attention:**
- First I→D→G draft will validate the voice architecture in practice
- May need voice calibration after initial generation

**Questions to Resolve:**
- Which chapter to generate first (Prologue or Chapter 1)?
- How to handle existing strong content (e.g., slug line story) during regeneration?
