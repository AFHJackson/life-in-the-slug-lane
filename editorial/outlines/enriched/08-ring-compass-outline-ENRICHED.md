## LAYER 2: ENTITY MANDATES

### Must Appear (with canonical precision):

| Entity | Section | Usage | Canonical Definition |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Category Error (Slug Line) | Phase 1 | Opening story | "What if someone tried to pay?" |
| Hospital Waiting Room | Phase 1 | Supporting story | Family need vs. safety triage |
| The Ring Compass | Section 1 | Core framework | Navigation tool with Three Questions |

| Ideological Lock-In | Section 3 | Pattern | Forcing one tool onto all situations |
| Centralization-Sacrifice Principle | Section 3 | Rule | Authority matches sacrifice required |
| Four Generosity Expressions | Section 3 | Application | Generosity looks different in each habitat |

### Must NOT Appear (scope discipline):

| Entity | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Malia the Baker | Ch 9 opening |
| Matt's Week | Ch 10 opening |
| Full Obligation development | Ch 9 content |
| Stewardship framework | Ch 10 content |

### Terminology Precision:
- "The Ring Compass" is the canonical term
- "Three Compass Questions" NOT "navigation questions"
- "Ideological Lock-In" is the canonical term
- "Habitat shift" NOT "context change"
- "Grammar" means habitat logic (established usage)

---

## LAYER 3: LOGICAL FLOW DEPENDENCIES

### Preconditions for This Chapter:
Reader must already:
- Know all four habitats (Ch 3-6)
- Understand hybrids (Ch 7)
- Have experienced grammar mismatch (Ch 7)
- Know category error concept (Ch 7)

### Internal Logic Chain:

```
Phase 1: Category Error + Hospital Waiting Room (felt wrongness)
   ↓ establishes: "I've used wrong grammar without knowing"
   
Section 1: Three Compass Questions (tool introduced)
   ↓ establishes: "I can diagnose with three questions"
   
Section 2: Recognition → Navigation (skill upgrade)
   ↓ establishes: "I'm not just seeing—I'm choosing"
   
Section 3: Habitat Shifts + Lock-In (advanced patterns)
   ↓ establishes: "I can spot shifts and avoid lock-in"
   
Phase 3: Navigation equipped
   → creates: "I have a tool. I can use it in real time."
```

### Verification Chain:

Each verification should test:

1. **"Think of a situation you're currently navigating. Who's involved?"**
   - Tests: First Compass Question
   - Surfaces: Scale indicator (intimate/community/stranger/chosen)
   - Creates recognition: "That tells me something"

2. **"In that same situation—what's at stake?"**
   - Tests: Second Compass Question
   - Surfaces: Stakes type (love/safety/value/trust)
   - Creates recognition: "Stakes point toward habitat"

3. **"Can the people in your situation leave easily?"**
   - Tests: Third Compass Question
   - Surfaces: Exit availability
   - Creates recognition: "Exit availability signals habitat"

4. **"What's your native habitat—where you feel most comfortable?"**
   - Tests: Default grammar recognition
   - Surfaces: Personal tendency
   - Creates recognition: "I default to this grammar"

5. **"Think of someone who applies one logic to everything. What problems does that create?"**
   - Tests: Lock-in recognition
   - Surfaces: Scale errors from rigidity
   - Creates recognition: "I can see ideological lock-in"

6. **"Think of a time when stakes changed suddenly. Did you switch grammars?"**
   - Tests: Shift recognition
   - Surfaces: Personal experience with shifts
   - Creates recognition: "I can spot habitat shifts"

## LAYER 4: VOICE CONSTRAINTS

### Phase-Specific Tone:

| Phase | Target % | Dominant Mode | Avoid | Target Effect |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| I Opening | 12% (780-910 words) | Felt wrongness, recognition | Lecturing, theory | "I've done this" |
| D Middle | 68% (4,420-5,100 words) | Testing, verifying, building | Over-complication | "I can use this" |
| G Close | 20% (850-1,000 words) | Equipping, empowering | Prescribing | "I have a tool" |

### Phase 1 Voice Markers:
- Category Error is FELT before explained
- Hospital Waiting Room shows mismatch PAIN
- "You felt that wrongness before you understood it"
- "What you needed was a compass"
- Reader thinks: "I've used the wrong grammar without knowing"

### Phase 2 Voice Markers:
- Three Questions presented as TESTABLE tool
- Each question verified against reader's own situation
- Instrument Flying metaphor makes trust-the-tool concrete
- Lawrence Taylor shows INSTANT shift recognition
- Lock-in patterns tested (reader identifies in themselves)
- Limits acknowledged: "The compass gives a starting point, not a final answer"
- "Navigation should be fast, not academic"

### Phase 3 Voice Markers:
- Recognition language: "You'll now see...", "You can run this..."
- NO prescription: Not "You should navigate..."
- Rally-ready phrases for sharing
- "I have a tool. I can use it."
- Forward pull to excess: "But what do you do with what you have?"

### Forbidden Patterns:
- ❌ "You should navigate this way" → ✅ "You'll now recognize..."
- ❌ Over-complicating the Compass → ✅ Three questions, simple
- ❌ Academic tone → ✅ Grounded and practical
- ❌ Too many examples → ✅ Hit key ones, move on
- ❌ Making navigation sound exhausting → ✅ Feels like gaining power

### Required Patterns:
- Category Error opens with FELT wrongness
- Three Questions each verified
- Instrument Flying metaphor included
- Lawrence Taylor shift example
- All four lock-in types shown
- Generosity expressions by habitat
- "Ideologies lock you to one tool. The Ring gives you four."

## LAYER 5: EXAMPLE SPECIFICATIONS

### Primary Story: Category Error (Slug Line)

**Mandatory Scene Elements:**

**The Offer:**
- You're in the slug line
- The ride went well
- At the end, you pull out your wallet
- "Here's five bucks—thanks for the ride."

**The Pause:**
- The driver's face changes
- Something shifted
- It's not offense exactly—it's confusion
- You feel it too: "That was wrong"

**The Analysis:**
- It's not that money is bad
- It's that you imported the wrong grammar
- The slug line runs on voluntary trust, not market exchange
- "The line doesn't get in" (category boundary enforced)

**Key Passage:**
> "You felt that wrongness before you understood it. The money was right in a different context. Here, it broke something. What you needed was a compass."

### Supporting Story: Hospital Waiting Room

**Mandatory Scene Elements:**

**The Scene:**
- You're in the ER with a family member
- The wait is hours
- You're scared, vulnerable, needing connection

**The Mismatch:**
- You want family-level response (care, intimacy, reassurance)
- They're providing safety-commons logic (impartial, standardized, triaged)
- Both are right in their logic
- "The compass doesn't make the mismatch painless. It makes the mismatch visible."

### Key Example: Lawrence Taylor/Theismann

**Mandatory Scene Elements:**

**The Setup:**
- November 18, 1985, Monday Night Football
- Lawrence Taylor is hunting Joe Theismann
- Market logic: paid competition, controlled violence

**The Shift:**
- The leg snaps
- Instantly, Taylor calls for medics
- His face shows horror, not triumph
- The game stops

**The Insight:**
- One second: Market habitat (paid competition)
- Next second: Safety habitat (medical emergency)
- Taylor switches instantly
- "The compass spun, and he read it correctly"

**Key Passage:**
> "When the stakes change, the grammar must change."

### The Three Compass Questions Table

**Must Appear:**

**Question 1: Who's involved?**
| Answer | Likely Habitat |
|--------|----------------|
| Intimates (2-20) | Family |
| Community/Population | Safety |
| Strangers at scale | Market |
| Chosen connections | Friendship |

**Question 2: What's at stake?**
| Answer | Likely Habitat |
|--------|----------------|
| Love, belonging, identity | Family |
| Life, safety, crisis | Safety Commons |
| Value, exchange, coordination | Market |
| Trust, reputation, connection | Friendship |

**Question 3: Can they exit?**
| Answer | Likely Habitat |
|--------|----------------|
| Exit costly/impossible | Family or Safety |
| Exit easy | Market or Friendship |
| Exit should be protected | Anarchy (voluntary) |
| Exit isn't the issue | Safety (universal service) |

### Four Lock-In Types

**Must Include All Four:**

| Type | Pattern | Failure |
|------|---------|---------|
| Market fundamentalist | "Everything can be priced" | Can't see what isn't for sale |
| Safety fundamentalist | "Everything is a crisis" | Securitizes daily existence |
| Family fundamentalist | "We should all just love each other" | Can't see why nations aren't families |
| Anarchy fundamentalist | "Everything should be voluntary" | Can't see why fire departments need taxes |

## LAYER 6: TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS

### Into This Chapter (from Chapter 7):

**Chapter 7 ended with:**
- "You can see hybrids now. But how do you choose which tool? That's navigation—and there's a compass for it."

**Chapter 8 must immediately:**
- Open with Category Error story (felt wrongness)
- Show why a compass is needed
- Begin building the navigation tool

### Between Sections:

| From | To | Bridge Required |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Phase 1 (Category Error) | Section 1 | "Let's build the compass." |
| Section 1 (Three Questions) | Section 2 | "You have the tool—now upgrade the skill." |
| Section 2 (Recognition → Navigation) | Section 3 | "But situations shift. Lock-in happens." |
| Section 3 (Shifts/Lock-In) | Phase 3 | "Here's what you can now do." |

### Out of This Chapter (to Chapter 9):

**Final Direction:**
- Reader should be asking: "What do I do with what I have?"
- Chapter 8 ends with: "You can navigate The Ring now. But there's one more question: What do you do with your excess?"

**Chapter 9 Must Immediately:**
- Open with Malia the Baker
- Address surplus and obligation
- Begin the Obligation to Excess development

**Required Transition:**
- "Navigation tells you which tool to use. But it doesn't tell you what to do with what you've generated."

## CROSS-REFERENCE: KEY PASSAGES FOR SONNET

These passages MUST appear or be closely paraphrased:

1. **The Felt Wrongness:**
> "You felt that wrongness before you understood it. The money was right in a different context. Here, it broke something. What you needed was a compass."

2. **The Core Rally:**
> "Ideologies lock you to one tool. The Ring gives you four."

3. **The Shift Truth:**
> "When the stakes change, the grammar must change."

4. **The Navigation Definition:**
> "Navigation isn't neutrality. It's mastery. You're not avoiding commitment—you're matching tools to situations."

5. **The Compass Limit:**
> "The compass gives you a starting point, not a final answer. Sometimes the questions point in different directions. Choosing between them still requires judgment."

6. **The Instrument Insight:**
> "Trust the compass when visibility is low."
