## LAYER 2: ENTITY MANDATES

### Must Appear (with canonical precision):

| Entity | Section | Usage | Canonical Definition |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Slug Line | Phase 1 | Return with analysis | Full from database: "informal carpool...all four habitats" |
| Green Acura Driver | Phase 1 | Mystery answered | "Generosity without invoice" |
| Communist Christmas | Phase 1 | Supporting story | "Presents purchased through markets, distributed by family logic" |
| Hybrids | Section 1 | Core concept | "Mixing of habitat logics in real institutions" |
| Grammar Mismatch | Section 3 | Failure mode | "Two people operating in different habitats without realizing it" |
| Category Error (Slug Line) | Section 3 | Key example | "What if someone tried to pay?" |

### Must NOT Appear (scope discipline):

| Entity | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Malia the Baker | Ch 9 opening |
| Matt's Week | Ch 10 opening |
| Ring Compass (full) | Ch 8 content |
| Full Obligation to Excess | Ch 9 content |

### Terminology Precision:
- "Hybrids" NOT "blends" or "mixtures" (hybrids is book term)
- "Grammar mismatch" is the canonical term
- "Category error" for importing wrong logic
- "Which tool fits this moment?" is the diagnostic question
- "Habitats touch" NOT "systems overlap"

---

## LAYER 3: LOGICAL FLOW DEPENDENCIES

### Preconditions for This Chapter:
Reader must already:
- Know all four habitats (Ch 3-6)
- Have experienced Slug Line without framework (Prologue)
- Understand Scale Error (Ch 1)
- Have seen "When Friendship Gets HR" (Ch 1)
- Know all four identities (Ch 6 completion)

### Internal Logic Chain:

```
Phase 1: Slug Line Return (all four habitats visible in one system)
   ↓ establishes: "Pure systems don't exist—this is a hybrid"
   
Phase 1b: Communist Christmas (market + family hybrid)
   ↓ establishes: "Hybrids are everywhere—even holidays"
   
Section 1: Hybrids are normal (pure systems fail)
   ↓ establishes: "Every functioning institution is a hybrid"
   
Section 2: When hybrids work (right tool, right moment)
   ↓ establishes: "Mastery is matching tool to moment"
   
Section 3: When hybrids fail (grammar mismatch, category error)
   ↓ establishes: "I can diagnose what's going wrong"
   
Phase 3: Hybrid navigation equipped
   → creates: "I can see hybrids operating everywhere"
```

### Verification Chain:

Each verification should test:

1. **"Think of your workplace. Where does market logic operate? Family logic?"**
   - Tests: Hybrid recognition
   - Surfaces: "I can see both operating"
   - Creates recognition: Every organization is hybrid

2. **"Think of a holiday gathering. What provides the gifts? What distributes them?"**
   - Tests: Communist Christmas pattern
   - Surfaces: "Market buys, family distributes"
   - Creates recognition: Hybrids are everywhere

3. **"Think of a frustrating conversation that felt off. Were you speaking different grammars?"**
   - Tests: Grammar mismatch diagnosis
   - Surfaces: "I wanted friendship, they wanted transaction"
   - Creates recognition: Mismatch is diagnosable

4. **"Think of someone who offered to pay when payment felt wrong. Why did it feel wrong?"**
   - Tests: Category error recognition
   - Surfaces: "Wrong logic for that moment"
   - Creates recognition: Context determines appropriate grammar

5. **"What habitats are touching in your current situation?"**
   - Tests: Practical navigation
   - Surfaces: Multiple habitats in play
   - Creates recognition: "I can analyze this in real time"

## LAYER 4: VOICE CONSTRAINTS

### Phase-Specific Tone:

| Phase | Target % | Dominant Mode | Avoid | Target Effect |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| I Opening | 20% (1,400-1,600 words) | Return, recognition, humor | Theory, lecturing | "I remember this!" |
| D Middle | 60% (4,200-4,800 words) | Analysis, diagnosis | Over-complexity | "I can see the pattern" |
| G Close | 20% (1,400-1,600 words) | Equipping, practical | Prescribing | "I can navigate this" |

### Phase 1 Voice Markers:
- RETURN energy: "Remember the slug line?"
- Mastery revelation: "Now you can see"
- Each habitat labeled in the Slug Line
- Green Acura mystery ANSWERED
- Communist Christmas with humor
- "Christmas is a hybrid. So is almost everything else."

### Phase 2 Voice Markers:
- Pure systems fail examples (USSR, etc.)
- Successful hybrid examples (Costco, communities)
- Grammar mismatch clearly explained
- Category error (paying in slug line) visceral
- "Half of organizational dysfunction is grammar mismatch"
- Diagnostic questions introduced

### Phase 3 Voice Markers:
- "See the hybrids you're already in"
- Practical diagnostic questions
- "Navigating hybrids is the actual skill"

- ❌ Endless hybrid examples → ✅ Hit key ones, move on
- ❌ Academic hybrid theory → ✅ Stay grounded
- ❌ Making it too complex → ✅ Four habitats is enough
- ❌ Moral judgment on failures → ✅ Diagnostic, not judgmental

### Required Patterns:
- Slug Line analyzed with all four habitats
- Green Acura Driver mystery answered
- Communist Christmas lands with humor
- Grammar mismatch is actionable (not just descriptive)

## LAYER 5: EXAMPLE SPECIFICATIONS

### Primary Story: Return to the Slug Line

**Mandatory Scene Elements:**

**The Return:**
- "Remember the slug line? The informal carpool system that nobody designed and nobody runs?"
- "Let's look at it again—now that you can see."

**Four Habitats Visible:**

| Element | Habitat | What to Show |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| HOV lanes | Safety/Socialism | "Roads maintained by tax dollars" |
| Gas savings | Market/Capitalism | "Individual incentive drives participation" |
| Unwritten rules | Friendship/Anarchy | "Reputation governs behavior—emergent order" |
| Green Acura | Family/Communism | "Generosity without invoice—from-each-to-each" |

**The Key Passage:**
> "The slug line is embarrassing to ideologues because it won't stay put. It's not capitalism—no price. It's not socialism—no government. It's not communism—strangers involved. It's not anarchy—it depends on public roads. It's all four at once."

**The Insight:**
> "It works because it's a good hybrid—not despite being a hybrid."

### Supporting Story: Communist Christmas

**Must Include:**
- "Think about how gift-giving actually works in most families at Christmas"
- "The presents are purchased through markets—capitalism generates the surplus"
- "They're distributed according to a completely different logic: from each according to ability, to each according to need"
- "Nobody's keeping score"
- Market provides, family distributes, norms are voluntary

**Must Convey:**
- Habitats don't just coexist—they interpenetrate
- "Christmas is a hybrid. So is almost everything else."

### Key Example: Category Error (Paying in Slug Line)

**Must Include:**
- "What if someone in the slug line tried to pay?"
- "'Here's five bucks—thanks for the ride.'"
- "It would feel wrong. Not because money is bad, but because you're importing market grammar into a space running on voluntary trust."
- "The line doesn't get in" (category boundary enforced)

**Must Convey:**
- Market logic isn't wrong—it's wrong HERE
- The offer changes the relationship
- Context determines appropriate grammar

### Key Example: Grammar Mismatch

**Must Include:**
- Business partner who expects friend treatment: "Why are you charging me? We're friends!"
- Hospital waiting room: family-level response vs. population-scale triage
- "Two grammars, one conversation—nobody is wrong"
- "Half of organizational dysfunction is grammar mismatch"

## LAYER 6: TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS

### Into This Chapter (from Chapter 6):

**Chapter 6 ended with:**
- "But they don't just sit separately—they touch. Hybrids happen."
- Ring completion achieved

**Chapter 7 must immediately:**
- Return to Slug Line with "Remember this?"
- Show all four habitats operating in one system
- Reveal: "This is what a good hybrid looks like"

### Between Sections:

| From | To | Bridge Required |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Phase 1 (Slug Line) | Communist Christmas | "This isn't unique to commuting." |
| Communist Christmas | Section 1 | "Hybrids are everywhere. Let's understand them." |
| Section 1 (Pure fails) | Section 2 | "What makes hybrids actually work?" |
| Section 2 (Success) | Section 3 | "But hybrids can fail too." |
| Section 3 (Failure) | Phase 3 | "So how do you navigate?" |

### Out of This Chapter (to Chapter 8):

**Final Direction:**
- Reader should be asking: "How do I know which tool to use when?"
- Chapter 7 ends with: "You can see hybrids now. But how do you choose which tool? That's navigation—and there's a compass for it."

**Chapter 8 Must Immediately:**
- Introduce Ring Compass
- Transform recognition into intentional navigation
- Give reader practical decision tool

**Required Transition:**
- "Seeing hybrids is the first step. Navigating them intentionally is the next."

## CROSS-REFERENCE: KEY PASSAGES FOR SONNET

These passages MUST appear or be closely paraphrased:

1. **The Slug Line Truth:**
> "The slug line is embarrassing to ideologues because it won't stay put. It's not capitalism—no price. It's not socialism—no government. It's not communism—strangers involved. It's not anarchy—it depends on public roads. It's all four at once."

2. **The Core Insight:**
> "Every great institution is a hybrid. The bad ones just don't know it."

3. **The Mismatch Truth:**
> "Half of organizational dysfunction is grammar mismatch. People in the same room, using different habitat logics, talking past each other."

4. **The Navigation Question:**
> "The question isn't which ideology wins. The question is which tool you pull out when."

5. **The Category Error:**
> "It would feel wrong. Not because money is bad, but because you're importing market grammar into a space running on voluntary trust."
