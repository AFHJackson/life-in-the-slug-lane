## LAYER 2: ENTITY MANDATES

### Must Appear (with canonical precision):

| Entity | Section | Usage | Canonical Definition |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Malia the Baker (Hilo Story) | Phase 1 | Opening story | Full new content from new-content-ch9-malia-excess.md |
| The Widow's Mite Reframe | Phase 1 | Supporting story | "Matter of trust, not amount" |
| Three-Pile Framework | Section 1 | Reviewed | Necessities/Surplus/Excess |
| Mechanism of Influence | Section 1 | Framework | Excellence → Surplus → Excess → Influence |
| Two Paths (Discovery/Generosity) | Section 2 | Core framework | Both valid outlets for excess |
| Sustainable Generosity | Section 2 | Principle | "Give from the third pile" |
| Vocation as Excellence | Section 2 | Key insight | "Excellence is the engine of obligation" |
| Hoarding as Failure | Section 3 | Pattern | Excess that doesn't move |
| The Useful Question | Phase 3 | Application | "Who am I inside this?" |

### Must NOT Appear (scope discipline):

| Entity | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Matt's Week | Ch 10 opening |
| Stewardship framework | Ch 10 content |
| 25-year vision | Appendix content |

### Terminology Precision:
- "Obligation" NOT "guilt" (obligation activates, guilt paralyzes)
- "Excess" NOT "wealth" (excess is discretionary, wealth is assets)
- "Two Paths" is the canonical term
- "Sustainable Generosity" is the canonical term
- "Hoarding" NOT "saving" (buffer is good; hoarding is frozen excess)

---

## LAYER 3: LOGICAL FLOW DEPENDENCIES

### Preconditions for This Chapter:
Reader must already:
- Know Three-Pile Framework (Ch 5)
- Understand markets generate surplus (Ch 5)
- Have Ring Compass for navigation (Ch 8)
- Know four generosity expressions (Ch 8)

### Internal Logic Chain:

```
Phase 1: Malia the Baker (progression felt, not just explained)
   ↓ establishes: "Excellence produces excess"
   
Phase 1b: Widow's Mite (obligation isn't about amount)
   ↓ establishes: "Excess is relative; obligation is universal"
   
Section 1: Surplus → Excess (transition tested)
   ↓ establishes: "I can identify my own excess"
   
Section 2: Two Paths (discovery and generosity tested)
   ↓ establishes: "Both paths are valid—the choice is situational"
   
Section 3: Hoarding (failure mode tested)
   ↓ establishes: "I can recognize when excess isn't moving"
   
Phase 3: Obligation recognized
   → creates: "I have excess. Now I see what it asks of me."
```

### Verification Chain:

Each verification should test:

1. **"Does your work generate more value than you strictly need to survive?"**
   - Tests: Surplus recognition
   - Surfaces: Gap between production and need
   - Creates recognition: "That's where surplus begins"

2. **"After necessities and a reasonable buffer, is there anything left?"**
   - Tests: Excess identification
   - Surfaces: Discretionary resources (not just money)
   - Creates recognition: "That's my excess"

3. **"Think about guilt vs. obligation—which moved you to action?"**
   - Tests: Distinction between guilt and obligation
   - Surfaces: Obligation activates, guilt paralyzes
   - Creates recognition: "Obligation is the fuel"

4. **"How do you currently allocate your excess? Is it intentional?"**
   - Tests: Current path awareness
   - Surfaces: Allocation between discovery and generosity
   - Creates recognition: "I can choose more deliberately"

5. **"Have you noticed that more buffer doesn't reduce anxiety about having enough?"**
   - Tests: Hoarding psychology
   - Surfaces: "The goalpost moves"
   - Creates recognition: "That's the psychology of hoarding"

6. **"What needs do you see that others miss?"**
   - Tests: Jobs-to-be-done visibility
   - Surfaces: Unique positioning for excess deployment
   - Creates recognition: "Only I can deploy my excess this way"

## LAYER 4: VOICE CONSTRAINTS

### Phase-Specific Tone:

| Phase | Target % | Dominant Mode | Avoid | Target Effect |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| I Opening | 12% (780-910 words) | Warmth, progression, recognition | Theory, lecturing | "I see the progression" |
| D Middle | 68% (4,420-5,100 words) | Testing, verifying, building | Prescribing, shaming | "I can identify my excess" |
| G Close | 20% (850-1,000 words) | Equipping, empowering | Moralizing | "I know what it asks" |

### Phase 1 Voice Markers:
- Malia story is WARM and CONCRETE
- Hilo specificity (4 AM, Kilauea Avenue, Mrs. Chen)
- Progression SHOWN: 8 loaves → 100 → 1,000 → excess
- Both paths visible: Tyler's ice cream (discovery), shelters and shut-ins (generosity)
- "What happens when you pursue mastery long enough..."
- Widow's Mite shows obligation isn't about amount

### Phase 2 Voice Markers:
- Three Piles reviewed and tested
- Obligation vs. guilt distinction clear
- Two Paths presented as BOTH valid
- Sustainable Generosity emphasized ("can't pour from empty cup")
- Hoarding tested against reader's observations
- Limits acknowledged: "Not everyone has excess yet"
- "This isn't a framework for judging others"

### Phase 3 Voice Markers:
- "Your excess is probably larger than you think"
- "Who am I inside this?" as orientation question
- NO prescription: Not "give X%"
- "Discovery or generosity. Choose one. But choose."
- Forward pull to stewardship

### Forbidden Patterns:
- ❌ "You should give X%" → ✅ "You can see your allocation now"
- ❌ Prosperity gospel → ✅ Excellence precedes excess (not for accumulation)
- ❌ Wealth shaming → ✅ Excess is earned, now deploy it
- ❌ Abstract ethics → ✅ Stay grounded in Malia, Mrs. Chen, Tyler
- ❌ One-size-fits-all advice → ✅ Everyone's situation differs
- ❌ Prescribing discovery vs. generosity → ✅ Both valid

### Required Patterns:
- Malia's full progression (from new content)
- Widow's Mite reframe (trust, not amount)
- Three Piles reviewed with verification
- Both paths validated
- Hoarding as the only failure mode
- "Discovery or generosity. Choose one. But choose."

## LAYER 5: EXAMPLE SPECIFICATIONS

### Primary Story: Malia the Baker (Hilo Story)

**Use full content from:** `new-content-ch9-malia-excess.md`

**Mandatory Scene Elements:**

**The Progression:**
- At the ovens by 4 AM, thirty years
- Started with 8 loaves (subsistence)
- Now makes 100 before dawn (mastery)
- Four bakeries across Hilo
- "The strange gift of mastery: the ability to produce beyond demand"

**The Discovery Path (Tyler & Jen):**
- Hilo Homemade Ice Cream
- Can't get cookie texture right for ice cream sandwiches
- Malia spent six weekends on cookie recipes
- "No charge. No contract. Just the joy of solving a problem that wasn't hers"

**The Generosity Path:**
- Forty excess loaves daily to three shelters
- Mrs. Chen (93, shut-in) gets birthday cake yearly
- 47 names on shut-in birthday list now
- High school baking class every Friday

**The Key Passage:**
> "You earned the opportunity to give freely. You produced surplus that made your business resilient, your employees secure. And then you produced excess that made your community better."

**The Emotional Beat:**
- Excellence, not ambition
- "Not because she had to. Because she could."
- "Excess came with an obligation. To share it. To risk it. To give it away. To refuse to hoard it."

### Supporting Story: The Widow's Mite Reframe

**Must Include:**
- "Usually told to shame the wealthy—but there's another reading"
- She gave everything because she trusted something larger
- It's about proportion (what's discretionary), not amount
- "Generosity flows from trust, not from wealth"
- "The rich man who gave much but kept his excess... hoarded"

**Must Convey:**
- Excess is relative
- Everyone has something discretionary
- Trust enables risk

### The Three Piles Review

**Must Appear (from Ch 5):**

| Pile | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Necessities | Survival + keep producing | Must protect |
| Surplus | Buffer against bad days | Should maintain |
| Excess | More than security requires | Free to move |

### The Mechanism of Influence

**Must Appear:**
```
Excellence → Surplus → Excess → Discovery/Generosity → Influence
```

> "If you want to have influence, start with excellence. Excellence generates the surplus that becomes excess. Excess deployed produces impact."

### Two Paths Table

**Must Appear:**

| Path | Meaning | Examples | When Right |
|------|---------|----------|------------|
| Discovery | Invest in future | R&D, startups, learning, art | Capacity for risk; see opportunity |
| Generosity | Meet present need | Giving, volunteering, mentorship | Immediate need visible |

### Hoarding Failure Modes

**Must Include All Three:**

| Failure | Description | Verification |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Economic | Capital parked is capital idle | "What happened to the system around hoarded resources?" |
| Personal | Anxiety replaces purpose; "enough" keeps moving | "More buffer doesn't reduce anxiety" |
| System | Others lack what you have; innovation starves | "Hoarding is extraction without return" |

---

## LAYER 6: TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS

### Into This Chapter (from Chapter 8):

**Chapter 8 ended with:**
- "You can navigate The Ring now. But there's one more question: What do you do with your excess?"

**Chapter 9 must immediately:**
- Open with Malia the Baker
- Show the progression from excellence to excess
- Reveal: "Excess creates obligation"

### Between Sections:

| From | To | Bridge Required |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Phase 1 (Malia) | Widow's Mite | "This isn't just for the wealthy." |
| Widow's Mite | Section 1 | "Let's see exactly how this works." |
| Section 1 (Surplus → Excess) | Section 2 | "What do you do with excess? Two paths." |
| Section 2 (Two Paths) | Section 3 | "But there's a failure mode." |
| Section 3 (Hoarding) | Phase 3 | "Here's what you can now see." |

### Out of This Chapter (to Chapter 10):

**Final Direction:**
- Reader should be asking: "How do I make these choices wisely over time?"
- Chapter 9 ends with: "Discovery or generosity. But making this choice wisely—over a lifetime, across all four habitats—requires stewardship."

**Chapter 10 Must Immediately:**
- Open with Matt's Week
- Address stewardship as sustained navigation
- Complete the operating framework

**Required Transition:**
- "Obligation to excess is one choice. But life is a sequence of choices—navigating habitats, deploying excess, building relationships. Doing this well, over time, is stewardship."

## CROSS-REFERENCE: KEY PASSAGES FOR SONNET

These passages MUST appear or be closely paraphrased:

1. **The Progression:**
> "This was what happened when you asked: How good can I get? The answer wasn't endless work. It wasn't becoming a slave to productivity. It was excellence. Mastery. And the quiet joy of producing so much value that you had abundance to give."

2. **The Obligation:**
> "Excess creates obligation. Not guilt—obligation. The difference matters. Guilt says: 'You shouldn't have this.' Obligation says: 'You have this—now what?' Guilt paralyzes; obligation activates."

3. **The Two Paths:**
> "Discovery or generosity. The question isn't which is better—both are obligations. The question is which fits your situation."

4. **The Hoarding Truth:**
> "Excess isn't the problem. Hoarding is. Excess demands movement. Choose discovery or generosity—but choose."

5. **The Sustainability:**
> "Sustainable generosity requires excess. Self-immolation isn't sustainable. You can't give from empty."

6. **The Malia Summary:**
> "Not because she had to. Because she could. Because she'd gotten so good that she'd moved past necessity, past surplus, into the strange and wonderful territory of excess."
