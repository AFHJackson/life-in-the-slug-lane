## LAYER 1: CROSS-CHAPTER THREAD MAPPING

### Threads This Chapter Receives:

| Thread | From | How It Lands Here |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Fire Truck Budget Meeting | Ch 4 | "Where does the surplus come from?" → NOW answered |
| Scale Error | Ch 1 | Applied: market logic in wrong places |
| The Ring | Ch 1 | Third habitat deep dive |
| Liberation from line | Ch 2 | Can explore "capitalism" without ideology |
| Family/Safety contrast | Ch 3-4 | Markets are different tool for different scale |

### Threads This Chapter Plants Forward:

| Thread | Plants Here | Receives In | Required Setup |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Three-Pile Framework | Core framework | Ch 9 (Obligation), Ch 10 (Stewardship) | Necessities → Surplus → Excess |
| Nail-Maker Parable | Opening story | Ch 9 (Malia), Ch 10 (Matt) | 8 nails → 10,000 nails |
| Obligation to Excess | Concept seeded | Ch 9 (full development) | "Excess is where obligation lives" |
| Market Blind Spots | Failure mode | Ch 7 (hybrid), Ch 8 (navigation) | Externalities, shared goods, intimacy, safety |
| When Engine Eats House | Scale error | Ch 7 (mismatch diagnosis) | Markets invading wrong habitats |
| "Markets are the engine" | Key phrase | Ch 10, Epilogue | Engine vs. purpose distinction |
| Underwriting the Other Habitats | System logic | Ch 7 (hybrid), Appendix | Taxes → safety, surplus → family stability |
| Nietzsche's Horse | Parable | Ch 9, Epilogue | Power without purpose = cruelty |

### Threads This Chapter Must NOT Use:
- Malia the Baker (Ch 9 opening)
- Matt's Week (Ch 10 opening)
- Ring Compass (Ch 8)
- Full Obligation to Excess development (Ch 9)
- Moving Day Scene (Ch 6)
- Cajun Navy (Ch 6)

### Elegant Emergence Notes:
- Third habitat deep dive—same pattern continues
- REHABILITATION of "capitalism" happens here
- Three-Pile Framework is CRITICAL for Ch 9 (Obligation to Excess)
- This chapter explains WHY Chapter 9's ethical claim makes sense
- "Capitalist at work" identity parallels "communist at home" and "socialist at 911"

## LAYER 2: ENTITY MANDATES

### Must Appear (with canonical precision):

| Entity | Section | Usage | Canonical Definition |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| The Nail-Maker Parable | Phase 1 | Opening story | Full content from database (8 → 10,000 nails) |
| The Grocery Aisle Insight | Phase 1 | Supporting story | "Think about the shirt on your back" |
| Three-Pile Framework | Section 2 | Core framework | Necessities, Surplus, Excess (canonical definitions) |
| Capitalism (as marketplace) | Section 1 | Habitat definition | "Individual innovation aligned to community needs" |
| Underwriting the Other Habitats | Section 2 | System connection | "$812,000 fire truck funded by surplus" |
| When the Engine Eats the House | Section 3 | Scale error | Market logic invading wrong habitats |
| Market Blind Spots | Section 3 | Failure modes | Externalities, shared goods, intimacy, safety |
| Nietzsche's Horse | Section 3 | Parable | "Power without purpose becomes cruelty" |

### Must NOT Appear (scope discipline):

| Entity | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Malia the Baker | Ch 9 opening (save for obligation chapter) |
| Matt's Week | Ch 10 opening |
| Ring Compass | Ch 8 content |
| Full Obligation ethics | Ch 9 development |
| Moving Day Scene | Ch 6 opening |

### Terminology Precision:
- "Three-Pile Framework" is the canonical name (NOT "three piles" alone)
- "Necessities, Surplus, Excess" are the canonical pile names
- "Capitalism (as marketplace)" NOT "capitalism" alone (always with scale clarifier)
- "Underwriting" is the canonical term for how markets fund other habitats
- "Excess" NOT "profit" (excess is specifically discretionary after prudent buffer)

---

## LAYER 3: LOGICAL FLOW DEPENDENCIES

### Preconditions for This Chapter:
Reader must already:
- Know family and safety habitats (Ch 3-4)
- Have seen Fire Truck Budget Meeting bridge (Ch 4)
- Understand scale errors (Ch 1)
- Be liberated from line-thinking (Ch 2)

### Internal Logic Chain:

```
Phase 1: Nail-Maker Parable (surplus GENERATED)
   ↓ establishes: "Specialization creates 1000x improvement"
   
Section 1: Markets as stranger-coordination
   ↓ establishes: "Price signals bundle information"
   
Section 2: Three-Pile Framework (surplus ORGANIZED)
   ↓ establishes: "I can see Necessities, Surplus, Excess in my own life"
   
Section 2b: Underwriting (surplus DISTRIBUTED)
   ↓ establishes: "Markets fund the other habitats"
   
Section 3: When Engine Eats House (surplus MISAPPLIED)
   ↓ establishes: "Markets have blind spots and boundaries"
   
Phase 3: Recognition equipped
   → creates: "I can see my three piles. Excess is where obligation lives."
```

### Verification Chain:

Each verification invitation should test:

1. **"Think about the last thing you bought. Do you know who made it?"**
   - Tests: Stranger coordination through markets
   - Surfaces: "No—and I don't need to"
   - Creates recognition: Price signals replace intimacy

2. **"Which expenses, if you stopped paying, would stop you functioning?"**
   - Tests: Identifying Necessities pile
   - Surfaces: Housing, food, basic transport
   - Creates recognition: First pile is non-negotiable

3. **"How much buffer do you have between income and catastrophe?"**
   - Tests: Identifying Surplus pile
   - Surfaces: "A month? Three months?"
   - Creates recognition: Second pile is prudence

4. **"After necessities and buffer, do you have anything left?"**
   - Tests: Identifying Excess pile
   - Surfaces: "Actually... yes"
   - Creates recognition: Third pile creates obligation

5. **"Where did the money that funds your fire department originally come from?"**
   - Tests: Understanding underwriting
   - Surfaces: "Market activity—someone sold something"
   - Creates recognition: Markets fund the commons

## LAYER 4: VOICE CONSTRAINTS

### Phase-Specific Tone:

| Phase | Target % | Dominant Mode | Avoid | Target Effect |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| I Opening | 12% (840-960 words) | Wonder, abundance | Lecturing, defending | "Where does this come from?" |
| D Middle | 68% (4,760-5,440 words) | Testing, organizing | Preaching, shaming | "I can see my own piles" |
| G Close | 20% (1,000-1,200 words) | Recognition, question | Prescribing, guilt-tripping | "Excess creates choice" |

### Phase 1 Voice Markers:
- Wonder at abundance: 8 nails → 10,000 nails
- Invisible coordination: "You don't know who made your shirt"
- Curiosity gap: "What do you do with ten thousand nails?"
- NOT ideology: "This is how strangers cooperate"

### Phase 2 Voice Markers:
- Three-Pile Framework as testable against reader's life
- Each pile verified: "Think about your own..."
- Underwriting connection: "Trace the taxes back"
- Market blind spots: Each with verification
- Nietzsche's Horse lands emotionally
- Limits acknowledged: "This isn't anti-market"

### Phase 3 Voice Markers:
- Recognition: "You can see your three piles now"
- Question planted: "What are you doing with your Excess?"
- NO guilt: Excess is opportunity, not sin
- NO prescription: That's Chapter 9
- Forward pull: "One more habitat: voluntary networks"

### Forbidden Patterns:
- ❌ "You should give more..." → ✅ "You can see your Excess now"
- ❌ Defending unlimited capitalism → ✅ "Markets have boundaries"
- ❌ Wealth inequality debate → ✅ Individual recognition focus
- ❌ "Capitalism is good" → ✅ "Capitalism works for strangers at scale"
- ❌ Shaming about consumption → ✅ Recognition without judgment

### Required Patterns:
- Each of three piles gets verification
- Each blind spot gets verification
- Nietzsche's Horse lands as felt parable
- Fire Truck Budget Meeting connects habitats
- Transition plants curiosity about friendship/anarchy

## LAYER 5: EXAMPLE SPECIFICATIONS

### Primary Story: The Nail-Maker Parable

**Mandatory Scene Elements:**

**Before Specialization (must convey):**
- Village where everyone does everything
- Eight nails on a good day
- "You do a little bit of everything, because you have to"
- Baseline: "exhausting, fragile, enough"

**The Specialization Moment (must convey):**
- Someone decides to just make nails
- Practice, refinement, focus
- 10,000 nails per day (NOT 8—ten THOUSAND)
- "Specialization doesn't improve by 10%. It improves by 1,000%."

**The Three Piles Emerge (must convey):**

| Pile | Size (in parable) | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Necessities | ~5,000 nails | "Must sell to live" |
| Surplus | ~4,000 nails | "Buffer, security, reinvestment" |
| Excess | ~1,000 nails | "Free to risk, experiment, give" |

**What Excess Enables (must convey):**
- Hooks, clips, experiments
- Teaching kids to build
- Most experiments fail—that's fine
- "None of those possibilities were obvious at 8 nails/day"

**Key Quote (must appear):**
> "Abundant generosity comes from producing more than you need... The excess pile is where freedom begins."

### Supporting Story: The Grocery Aisle Insight

**Must Include:**
> "Think about the shirt on your back. Somebody raised cotton. Somebody spun it. Somebody wove it. Somebody cut it. Somebody sewed it. You don't know any of them. You never will."

**Must Convey:**
- Thousands of specialists coordinating
- No central planner
- "Every price is a compressed encyclopedia of value"
- Works BECAUSE you're strangers

### Parable: Nietzsche's Horse

**Must Include:**
- Turin, January 3, 1889
- Coachman whipping stubborn horse
- Nietzsche embraces horse, weeping
- "Power without purpose becomes cruelty"

**Must Convey:**
