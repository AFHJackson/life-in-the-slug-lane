# Archived Chapter Outlines

This folder contains the original G+T (Galvanizing+Tenacity) chapter outlines that were superseded by the I→D→G voice architecture pivot (D008).

## Why Archived

These outlines followed the original voice architecture:
- **Target:** G+T readers (Galvanizing + Tenacity Working Geniuses)
- **Structure:** PART 1 (Story) / PART 2 (Framework) / PART 3 (Application)
- **Voice:** Prescriptive, action-oriented ("You should...", "Here's what to do...")

The I→D→G pivot (January 19, 2026) shifted to:
- **Target:** I+D+G readers (Invention + Discernment → Galvanizing)
- **Structure:** PHASE 1 (Invention) / PHASE 2 (Discernment) / PHASE 3 (Galvanizing)
- **Voice:** Diagnostic, verification-based ("You'll recognize...", "Think of a time when...")

## Current Working Outlines

The active outlines are in the parent folder with `-IDG.md` suffix:
- `00-prologue-outline-IDG.md`
- `01-one-size-fits-none-outline-IDG.md`
- etc.

## Do Not Use

These archived outlines should not be used for current writing. They are preserved for historical reference only.
