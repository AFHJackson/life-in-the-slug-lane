| Grok Capture Concept | Entity Database | Book DNA | Argument Spine | Status |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Capitalism:** Freedom of exchange, private ownership, innovation | ✅ "Capitalism (as marketplace)" - full definition with specialization, surplus, excess | ✅ Market = Capitalism habitat | ✅ Chapter 5: Surplus Engine | ✅ ALIGNED |
| **Socialism:** Roadways, infrastructure, police, safety - available to all equally regardless of contribution | ✅ "Socialism (as municipality)" - fire, police, roads, equal access | ✅ Safety = Socialism habitat | ✅ Chapter 4: Commons of Safety | ✅ ALIGNED |
| **Anarchy:** No terms, no leadership, self-adapting, friendships, voluntary engagement | ✅ "Anarchy (as friendship)" - voluntary cooperation, emergent order, trust-based | ✅ Friendship = Anarchy habitat | ✅ Chapter 6: Friendship, Anarchy, Order | ✅ ALIGNED |
| **Communism:** "From each according to ability, to each according to need" - like family | ✅ "Communism (as family)" - family scale, need-based distribution | ✅ Family = Communism habitat | ✅ Chapter 3: First Little Commune | ✅ ALIGNED |

**VERDICT: ✅ All four systems correctly captured and defined**

## SUMMARY: GAPS ADDRESSED

### ✅ RESOLVED (January 19, 2026):

1. **SACRIFICE GRADIENT** - Added to entity database
   - New entity: "Sacrifice Gradient" with full definition
   - Captures: Anarchy → Capitalism → Socialism → Communism = increasing sacrifice + centralization

2. **"GREATEST CONTROL = GREATEST SACRIFICE" PRINCIPLE** - Added to entity database
   - New entity with full definition
   - Key insight: Authority flows TO those who sacrifice most
   - Corruption pattern documented: when control used for benefit rather than sacrifice

3. **UNIFORMITY vs. INDIVIDUALITY GRADIENT** - Added to entity database
   - New entity with full definition
   - Right side (Socialism + Communism) = uniformity, common needs
   - Left side (Anarchy + Capitalism) = individuality, preferences

4. **BOOK DNA UPDATED** - Ring Gradients section added
   - All three gradients now in executive summary
   - Writing agents will have this context

### ⚠️ STILL NEEDS ATTENTION:

5. **SCALE NUMBER CONSISTENCY**
   - Verify consistent scale ranges across all documents:
     - Family: 2-20 (verify)
     - Municipality: 20-500? (verify)
     - Market: 500+? (verify)
     - Friendship: varies? (clarify)

## PROLOGUE OUTLINE CORRUPTION - FIXED

**Discovered:** January 19, 2026  
**Issue:** Prologue outline contained fabricated story details not from original manuscript

### Problem Identified:

The Prologue outline (`/editorial/outlines/00-prologue-outline.md`) had corrupted content:

| Element | WRONG (Outline Said) | CORRECT (Original Manuscript) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Time of day | 5:47 AM morning, "still dark" | Evening commute, "evening light had given up" |
| Location | "Suburban intersection" | Crystal City, walking toward Pentagon bus stop |
| Driver | Female (pronouns: "she," "her") | Male (pronouns: "he," "him") |
| Passengers | Two people (author + nurse in scrubs) | Author alone |
| Witching Hour | Morning HOV (inverted logic) | Evening HOV 3pm-6pm ET restriction ended |
| Opening scene | Invented 5:47 AM intersection scene | Green Acura pulls up as author walks alone |

### Root Cause:

The outline appeared to have been created from Book DNA patterns rather than grounded in the actual original manuscript content. This violated the principle that **all story elements must come from verified source material**.

### Resolution:

1. **Prologue Outline completely rewritten** to align with original manuscript
2. **Explicit grounding requirements added** to outline with checklist
3. **Source verification table added** linking each entity to manuscript/database
4. **Critical story facts section added** with explicit accuracy requirements

### Prevention Protocol:

For all outlines going forward:
- [ ] All story details must reference original manuscript or entity database
- [ ] No fabricated scenes, times, genders, or details
- [ ] Include "Source Verification" table linking content to sources
- [ ] Include "Critical Grounding Requirements" section
- [ ] Fictional examples (like thought experiments) are acceptable, but grounded stories must be accurate

| Four ingredients | Database full_content | ✅ ACCURATE |
| System of systems insight | Original manuscript | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Closing bridge to Ch 1 | Four-year-old performance review | ✅ ACCURATE |

### Content:

- Voice: G+T calibrated (rally-ready, action-oriented)
- Structure: Story → Context → Reflection → Promise
- Uses "familial" pattern instead of "communitarian"
