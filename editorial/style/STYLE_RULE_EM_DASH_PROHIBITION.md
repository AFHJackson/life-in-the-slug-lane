# STYLE RULE ADDENDUM: Em Dash Prohibition

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Rule Type:** Non-negotiable punctuation standard  
**Applies to:** All manuscript content

---

## THE RULE

**NEVER USE EM DASHES (—) ANYWHERE IN THE MANUSCRIPT**

This is a hard and fast rule with no exceptions.

---

## WHY THIS RULE EXISTS

**For G+T readers:**
- Em dashes create visual clutter
- They interrupt reading flow
- They slow momentum
- G+T readers need forward-moving prose, not meandering asides

**For consistency:**
- One punctuation style throughout
- Easier to maintain voice
- Cleaner manuscript appearance

---

## WHAT TO USE INSTEAD

### **Option 1: Periods (Full Stop)**

Use when the thought is complete and the next is related but separate.

❌ **DON'T:** "The Ring isn't a new idea—it's the map of where you already live."

✅ **DO:** "The Ring isn't a new idea. It's the map of where you already live."

**Effect:** Creates crisp, declarative statements. Good for rally-ready language.

---

### **Option 2: Commas (Pause)**

Use when the thoughts are closely connected and flow together.

❌ **DON'T:** "You're not confused—the map is broken."

✅ **DO:** "You're not confused, the map is broken."

**Effect:** Maintains flow while showing connection. Good for building arguments.

---

### **Option 3: Parentheses (Aside)**

Use when adding context or clarification that's not essential to the main point.

❌ **DON'T:** "Markets generate surplus—the engine that enables everything else—at scale."

✅ **DO:** "Markets generate surplus (the engine that enables everything else) at scale."

**Effect:** Keeps main sentence intact while adding helpful context. Use sparingly.

---

### **Option 4: Colons (Setup)**

Use when setting up an explanation or list.

❌ **DON'T:** "Success looks like this—markets creating discovery, commons serving everyone, friendships enabling growth."

✅ **DO:** "Success looks like this: markets creating discovery, commons serving everyone, friendships enabling growth."

**Effect:** Clear signal that explanation follows. Good for framework delivery.

---

### **Option 5: New Sentence (Simplest)**

When in doubt, break it into two sentences.

❌ **DON'T:** "We've been coasting—not because we lack capability—but because we've been fighting the wrong fights."

✅ **DO:** "We've been coasting. Not because we lack capability, but because we've been fighting the wrong fights."

**Effect:** Cleanest option. Never wrong. Default to this.

---

## ENFORCEMENT

### **Before Submitting Any Draft:**

1. **Search for "—"** in your document
2. **Replace every instance** using one of the five options above
3. **Verify zero em dashes remain**
4. **Submit clean draft**

### **If You're Tempted to Use an Em Dash:**

**STOP.** Ask yourself:
- Can this be two sentences? → Use periods
- Are the thoughts connected? → Use comma or colon
- Is this an aside? → Use parentheses
- None of the above? → Rewrite the sentence

### **Common Em Dash Patterns to Avoid:**

❌ "X—the thing that matters—Y" → Use parentheses or rewrite
❌ "X—here's why" → Use colon or period  
❌ "X—not Y—but Z" → Break into multiple sentences
❌ "X—emphasis—Y" → Use period for emphasis instead

## EXAMPLES FROM THE MANUSCRIPT

### **Example 1: Rally-Ready Language**

❌ **WITH EM DASH:**
"Scale errors—when the right tool hits the wrong scale—destroy what would otherwise work."

✅ **WITHOUT (Option 1 - Periods):**
"Scale errors destroy what would otherwise work. Right tool, wrong scale."

✅ **WITHOUT (Option 2 - Colon):**
"Scale errors destroy what would otherwise work: right tool, wrong scale."

**Best choice:** Periods (more impact, rally-ready)

---

### **Example 2: Framework Explanation**

❌ **WITH EM DASH:**
"The Ring—not a line with ends—shows you where you already live."

✅ **WITHOUT (Parentheses):**
"The Ring (not a line with ends) shows you where you already live."

✅ **WITHOUT (New sentences):**
"The Ring shows you where you already live. It's not a line with ends."

**Best choice:** New sentences (cleaner, more direct)

---

### **Example 3: Adding Context**

❌ **WITH EM DASH:**
"Markets generate surplus—more than needed for necessities—at population scale."

✅ **WITHOUT (Parentheses):**
"Markets generate surplus (more than needed for necessities) at population scale."

✅ **WITHOUT (Comma):**
"Markets generate surplus, more than needed for necessities, at population scale."

**Best choice:** Parentheses (keeps main sentence intact)

## RATIONALE SUMMARY

**Why no em dashes for this book:**

1. **G+T readers need momentum** - Em dashes slow reading
2. **Rally-ready language requires clarity** - Periods and colons are clearer
3. **Action-oriented prose needs forward motion** - Em dashes create pauses
4. **Visual consistency matters** - One punctuation style throughout
5. **Simplicity serves the message** - Fewer punctuation options = cleaner prose
