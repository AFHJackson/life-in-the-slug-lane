  "delta_type": "chapter_extraction",
  "summary": "Chapter 7 shows the four habitats operating simultaneously in real-world 'hybrids' - slug lines, disaster response, cooperatives, open-source projects, food pantries, and community clinics. Introduces key concepts: hybrids as the rule not exception, 'Communist Christmas' as hybrid example, disaster response showing all habitats, cooperative economics, and how we misdiagnose hybrids (downplaying scaffold, flattening gift layer, purist campaigns). Culminates in the 'hidden glue' of shared moral norms and 'sense of real value and meaning' that holds hybrids together.",
