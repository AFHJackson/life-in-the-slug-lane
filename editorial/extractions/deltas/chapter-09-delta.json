        "new_value": "Chapter 9 makes this the central theme: 'The path to sustainable generosity is not self-denial. It's self-discipline in pursuit of excellence.' Reframes vocation: 'Your calling isn't just \"do what you love\" or \"find your passion.\" It's \"become truly excellent enough in your craft that you reliably generate excess—then be intentional about what you do with it.\"' Excellence and generosity 'aren't separate virtues in tension. They're linked through the mechanism of excess.'",

        "new_value": "Chapter 9 shows the mechanism in action: 'Excellence → surplus → excess → discovery/generosity → better-functioning hybrids.' The nail-maker at 10,000 nails/day: Necessity pile (5,000 - covers survival), Surplus pile (4,000 - builds security, reinvests), Excess pile (1,000 - free to risk, experiment, give). 'The excess pile is where sustainable generosity lives.'",

        "field": "chapter_9_individual_information",
        "new_value": "Chapter 9 adds 'Jobs to Be Done' insight: Markets work because 'they let millions of complex, shifting, personal meanings interact and produce emergent order.' Only YOU can know what the $5.50 latte means in your specific context. 'No central planner, no matter how well-meaning or intelligent, can see inside your head.' Your participation 'isn't just \"selfish self-interest.\" It's you contributing irreplaceable information to a system-of-systems.'",

        "field": "chapter_9_full_loop",
        "new_value": "Chapter 9 completes the identity formation loop across all four habitats: (1) Family gives GIVEN identity - foundation of belonging and obligation, 'you matter because you exist'; (2) Friendship gives CHOSEN identity - 'the practice ground where you become who you want to be'; (3) Markets TEST that chosen identity at population scale - 'your character under pressure, your integrity when no one's watching'; (4) Tested identity circles back to all habitats. 'Identity isn't fixed. It's constantly being formed, tested, and reformed across all four habitats.'",

        "new_value": "Chapter 9 positions friendship/anarchy as essential middle layer: 'If you want to operate with integrity at population scale, you can't skip the practice ground.' Through 'repeated practice in these voluntary networks, certain traits harden into character': reliability, integrity, courage, kindness. 'You need the middle layer—the friendships, the teams, the communities of practice—where you practice being the kind of person you want to be when the stakes are high and no one's forcing you.'",

        "new_value": "Chapter 9 reveals what the ring means for personal operation: 'Your market participation is downstream of your identity formation in voluntary networks, which is itself downstream of the foundational lessons learned in family.' The ring shows 'you are not helpless' and also 'not the hero who fixes everything.' You are 'one of the irreplaceable actors in a system-of-systems that works or fails based on whether enough people like you operate with excellence and integrity.'",

        "definition": "How individual choices matter at population scale: 'Your excellence in your domain generates the surplus that feeds the ring.' When you become 'genuinely excellent at what you do—not just competent, not just \"good enough\"—you start producing more value than you personally need to sell or exchange to survive.' The formula: Excellence → surplus → excess → discovery/generosity → better-functioning hybrids. 'Your influence scales through the maturity of the YOU contributing, not the breadth of what you control.'",
