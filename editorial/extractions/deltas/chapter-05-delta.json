  "delta_type": "chapter_extraction",
  "summary": "Chapter 5 explores capitalism as the 'surplus engine' that powers the other habitats. Introduces the Nail-Maker Parable, the Three-Pile Framework (Necessities/Surplus/Excess), and the concept of 'Obligation to Excess.' Explores capitalism's four components, how markets underwrite other habitats, and the failure mode of market logic invading wrong rooms ('When the Engine Eats the House'). Closes with Nietzsche's horse story as a parable about power meeting its limits.",
