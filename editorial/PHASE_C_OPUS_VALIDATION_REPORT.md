## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Assessment: ✅ EXCELLENT with 1 CRITICAL REVISION REQUIRED

The Sonnet-generated manuscript demonstrates exceptional quality across 12 of 13 pieces. Voice architecture is precise, thread continuity is maintained, entity usage is largely canonical, and the I→D→G flow creates genuine reader engagement throughout.

**ONE CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** The Prologue contains canonical errors regarding the Green Acura Driver story that must be corrected before publication.

---

## CRITICAL REVISION REQUIRED

### Prologue: Green Acura Driver Scene

**Issue:** The generated Prologue fabricates details that contradict the canonical source material in the entity database and original manuscript.

**Canonical Facts (from entity-database-canonical.json):**
- **MALE driver** ("He said it...", "the driver called out")
- **EVENING commute** ("evening light had given up", "late enough")
- **Author was ALONE** (no second passenger)
- **Crystal City location** (walking toward Pentagon bus stop)
- **Driver's exact dialogue:** "You know it's past the witching hour" and "Don't worry about it. Jump in. I can get you to Tackett's Mill."
- **Author carrying Tackett's Mill slug sign**
- **Driver is going to Tackett's Mill** (sees author's destination sign)

**Sonnet's Errors:**
- ❌ Made driver FEMALE ("a woman probably in her fifties with glasses")
- ❌ Changed to MORNING (5:47 AM, 5:53 AM instead of evening)
- ❌ Added fabricated second passenger ("a nurse or maybe a tech... in scrubs")
- ❌ Changed location (general suburban intersection, not Crystal City)
- ❌ Altered dialogue completely ("Where are you headed?" / "Pentagon")
- ❌ Changed destination (Pentagon instead of Tackett's Mill)
- ❌ Removed Tackett's Mill slug sign detail

**Impact:** This error cascades into Chapter 7, which correctly analyzes "the Green Acura driver" but references a Prologue scene that doesn't match the canonical version.

**Required Action:** REGENERATE PROLOGUE with canonical accuracy.
