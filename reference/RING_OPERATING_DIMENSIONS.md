# Ring Operating Dimensions
## The Five Spectrums That Describe How the Habitats Actually Work

**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** Reference document for Chapters 7-10 development  
**Status:** Canonical - added to entity-database-canonical.json

## Overview

These five spectrums describe **how the Ring operates** - the actual characteristics that differentiate the four habitats and explain why each works at its proper scale.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Four Flattened Dimensions** (Chapter 2) = DIAGNOSTIC - explains what the broken left/right line compresses
- **Ring Operating Dimensions** (Chapters 7-10) = OPERATIONAL - describes how the Ring actually works

The Four Flattened Dimensions autopsy the old map. The Ring Operating Dimensions describe the new one.

## The Five Spectrums

### 1. Relationship Scale Spectrum

**Question:** What type of relationships does the individual experience in this habitat?

| Pole | Habitats | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Individual-to-Individual** | Anarchy, Communism | Close interaction with another person. Make guesses, take action, see results, adjust course. Real OODA loops operate. Can see how same action plays out differently in different relationships. |
| **Individual-to-Population** | Capitalism, Socialism | So many relationships at once that signals cancel out and amplify like electromagnetic waves. Cannot understand original context. Must use formed identity as instrumentation, observe "major land features" (marketplace responses, commons seams) rather than tailor on individual basis. |

**Mapping:**
```
Anarchy ←→ Communism     = Individual-to-Individual
Capitalism ←→ Socialism  = Individual-to-Population
```

### 2. Authority-Sacrifice Proportionality Spectrum

**Question:** How centralized is authority, and is it proportional to sacrifice?

| Position | Habitat | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Fully Decentralized** | Anarchy | Individual authority commensurate with getting/failing to get what you want. Ability to engage, withdraw, change terms as you see fit. |
| **Partially Decentralized** | Capitalism | Some centralization in regulations/policies, but individual actors retain substantial discretion. |
| **Partially Centralized** | Socialism | Much more centralization in standardization of commons, but still accountable to those served. |
| **Highly Centralized** | Communism/Family | Parent defines and determines terms and meaning. Prioritizes and organizes exchanges. BUT also maximally sacrifices, minimally gains. Their good moved across the table - measured in growth/benefit of the one in their charge. |

**Key Principle:** Authority must remain commensurate with sacrifice.
- High authority + low sacrifice = **predation**
- High sacrifice + low authority = **exploitation**

**Mapping:**
```
Anarchy → Capitalism → Socialism → Communism
(decentralized) ────────────────→ (centralized)
(low sacrifice) ─────────────────→ (high sacrifice)
```

### 3. Meaning of Exchange Spectrum

**Question:** Is the meaning/value of exchanges individually determined or universally fixed?

| Pole | Habitats | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Individualized Meaning** | Capitalism, Anarchy | Meaning based on complex mix of factors only measurable by the individual. Must continuously update as environment changes. Only YOU know what the $5.50 latte means in your context. No central planner can see inside your head. |
| **Universal Meaning** | Socialism, Communism | Truths of human species - food, water, shelter, clean air, safety, transportation. Do not change with age, culture, generation, or context. Shared needs anchored in common humanity. |

**Mapping:**
```
Capitalism/Anarchy    = Individual preferences determine value
Socialism/Communism   = Shared human needs determine value
```

---

### 4. Identity Role Spectrum (Formation vs. Function)

**Question:** Is identity being formed, or is it operating as an instrument?

| Pole | Habitats | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Identity Formation** | Anarchy, Communism | Identity being crafted/created. By family in childhood. By own choices, experiments, goals in friendships as one matures. Identity is being BUILT. |
| **Identity Function** | Capitalism, Socialism | Formed identities operating as key action drivers and decision-making sources. Within specialization (marketplace) and commonwealth actions (municipality). Like instruments on aircraft console in fog - allow effective action where natural individual-to-individual means are insufficient. |

**Key Insight:** You cannot skip the identity-forming habitats and expect to operate well in the identity-functioning habitats. Friendship is the practice ground for market and municipal life.

**Mapping:**
```
Communism/Anarchy       = Identity being formed
Capitalism/Socialism    = Identity in operation
```

---

### 5. Human Creation vs. Investment Spectrum

**Question:** Does this habitat serve human creation/development or human expression/investment?

**CRITICAL:** Unlike authority-sacrifice (proportional), this relationship is **INVERSE**.

| Position | Habitat | Creation | Expression |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Max Creation** | Communism/Family | Maximum creation, formation, protection | MINIMUM expression of what someone will do/accomplish |
| **Some Creation** | Socialism/Commons | Some protection | Expression beginning to appear |
| **Some Expression** | Capitalism/Marketplace | Less creation | Specialization and contributions light up expression |
| **Max Expression** | Anarchy/Friendship | Minimum creation (identity already formed) | Maximum expression and investment of formed person |

**Inverse Relationship:** High creation = low expression. High expression = low creation.

**Mapping:**
```
Communism (max creation, min expression)
    ↓
Socialism
    ↓
Capitalism
    ↓
Anarchy (min creation, max expression)
```

## Relationship to Ring Compass (Chapter 8)

The four dials of the Ring Compass are grounded in these five spectrums:

| Compass Dial | Related Spectrum(s) |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Resolution** (person vs population) | Relationship Scale |
| **Value Basis** (shared needs vs individual preferences) | Meaning of Exchange |
| **Authority Shape** (centralized vs decentralized) | Authority-Sacrifice Proportionality |
| **Identity Carrier** (given vs chosen) | Identity Role (Formation vs Function) |

The Ring Compass is the **practical diagnostic tool**. These spectrums are the **deeper theory** explaining why the compass works.

## Chapter Usage Map

| Chapter | Primary Usage |
|---------|---------------|
| **Chapter 2** | Four Flattened Dimensions (diagnostic) - NOT these spectrums |
| **Chapter 7: When Systems Touch** | How these spectrums explain hybrid tensions |
| **Chapter 8: Ring Compass** | Translating spectrums into four actionable dials |
| **Chapter 9: Obligation to Excess** | Identity Formation → Function flow; Creation → Investment flow |
| **Chapter 10: Stewardship** | Full navigation across all five spectrums |

## Quick Reference Table

| Spectrum | Anarchy | Capitalism | Socialism | Communism |
|----------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Relationship Scale** | Individual-to-individual | Individual-to-population | Individual-to-population | Individual-to-individual |
| **Authority** | Decentralized | Partially decentralized | Partially centralized | Highly centralized |
| **Sacrifice** | Low (self-governing) | Moderate | High (civic) | Maximum (parental) |
| **Meaning of Exchange** | Individual preferences | Individual preferences | Shared human needs | Shared human needs |
| **Identity Role** | Formation | Function | Function | Formation |
| **Human Creation** | Low | Low-Medium | Medium-High | High |
| **Human Expression** | High | Medium-High | Low-Medium | Low |

## Why This Matters

The Four Flattened Dimensions (Chapter 2) explain why political conversations get stuck - the line forces false choices by compressing orthogonal questions.

The Ring Operating Dimensions explain **how the Ring actually resolves those stuck conversations** - not by picking a point on the line, but by asking which habitat's logic fits the situation.

When someone is "stuck" in a political argument:
1. **Chapter 2 diagnosis:** They're probably flattening multiple dimensions into left/right
2. **Ring resolution:** Which habitat's operating logic fits this scale? This authority structure? This type of exchange meaning? This identity context?

The spectrums are the **grammar** of the Ring. The compass dials are the **vocabulary** for everyday use.
