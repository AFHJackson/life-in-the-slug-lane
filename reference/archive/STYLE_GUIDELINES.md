# STYLE GUIDELINES
**Purpose:** Voice, tone, and formatting standards for G+T-optimized manuscript  
**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026

---

## OVERVIEW

### Mission

**Write for G+T readers with clarity, confidence, and conversational warmth.**

These guidelines ensure every sentence serves:
1. **Galvanizing (G) readers:** Rally-ready frameworks, shareable insights, aha moments
2. **Tenacity (T) readers:** Clear completion milestones, action pathways, satisfying synthesis
3. **Book mission:** Insight that enables action, frameworks that empower stewardship

**Target:** General educated reader, 14+ reading level, conversational but smart

**Models:** Malcolm Gladwell (story-driven insight), Peter Zeihan (confident forward-looking)

---

## CORE VOICE PRINCIPLES

### What Our Voice IS

**Conversational**
- Write like a smart friend explaining something important
- Use "you" freely
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Vary sentence length naturally
- Example: "Here's what matters. Not the theory—the pattern you can actually use."

**Direct**
- Say what you mean in plain language
- No academic hedging
- No bureaucratic padding
- Front-load key insights
- Example: "Markets generate surplus. That's not ideology—it's observation."

**Confident**
- Diagnostic, not preachy
- Assert clearly when you know something
- Admit limits when you don't
- Trust the reader's intelligence
- Example: "This is how it works" not "One might argue that perhaps..."

**Warm**
- Reader is on our side
- We're in this together
- Empathetic but not saccharine
- Human stakes matter
- Example: "You already do this instinctively. You just haven't had words for it."

---

### What Our Voice IS NOT

**Academic**
- ❌ No peer-review prose
- ❌ No "the literature suggests"
- ❌ No excessive citations mid-flow
- ❌ No showing off vocabulary
- Example of BAD: "The extant research indicates a correlation between..."
- Example of GOOD: "Studies show that..."

**Preachy**
- ❌ No moral grandstanding
- ❌ No "you should be ashamed"
- ❌ No partisan cheerleading
- ❌ No finger-wagging
- Example of BAD: "If you really cared about justice, you would..."
- Example of GOOD: "Here's what happens when we get this wrong..."

**Cynical**
- ❌ No "everything is hopeless"
- ❌ No sneering at idealism
- ❌ No cheap shots
- ❌ No despair masquerading as realism
- Example of BAD: "Of course nothing will ever change, so why bother?"
- Example of GOOD: "This is hard. But here's what's actually possible."

**Wishy-Washy**
- ❌ No endless hedging
- ❌ No "perhaps possibly maybe"
- ❌ No hiding behind qualifiers
- ❌ No both-sidesism when clarity matters
- Example of BAD: "One might consider that it's possible this could potentially..."
- Example of GOOD: "This is what the evidence shows."

---

## SENTENCE-LEVEL STYLE

### Active Voice (Default)

**Prefer active constructions:**

❌ **Passive:** "The surplus is generated by markets."  
✅ **Active:** "Markets generate surplus."

❌ **Passive:** "A decision must be made by the reader."  
✅ **Active:** "You decide."

**Exception:** Passive voice is fine when:
- The actor is unknown or irrelevant
- You want to emphasize the action/object
- Example: "The fire truck was maintained" (who maintained it doesn't matter)

---

### Present Tense (Default for Analysis)

**Use present tense for frameworks and ongoing truths:**

❌ **Past:** "In Chapter 5, we argued that markets generated surplus."  
✅ **Present:** "Markets generate surplus. Chapter 5 showed how."

❌ **Past:** "The Ring consisted of four habitats."  
✅ **Present:** "The Ring consists of four habitats."

**Exception:** Past tense for:
- Historical events: "The French Revolution created the left/right line."
- Completed actions: "Sarah walked into the break room."
- Narrative scenes: "The driver pulled up and rolled down his window."

---

### Second Person (Use Freely)

**Address the reader directly:**

❌ **Third:** "One might notice that systems overlap."  
✅ **Second:** "You'll notice that systems overlap."

❌ **Third:** "The reader should ask themselves..."  
✅ **Second:** "Ask yourself..."

**This creates engagement and immediacy.**

---

### Sentence Variety

**Mix short and long for rhythm:**

**Too monotonous (all medium):**
> "Markets are complex systems. They coordinate millions of people. They use prices as signals. They generate surplus at scale."

**Better (varied length):**
> "Markets are complex. They coordinate millions of people through a simple mechanism: prices. When they work well, they generate surplus at scale. When they fail, everyone suffers."

**Even better (rhythm + stakes):**
> "Markets are complex. Dead simple in theory—prices signal what people value—and bewilderingly intricate in practice. When they work, surplus flows. When they break, people starve."

---

### Paragraph Length

**G+T readers scan aggressively. Break up walls of text.**

**Maximum paragraph length:** 6-7 lines in print (roughly 150-200 words)

**Better:** Mix short (1-2 lines) and medium (3-5 lines) paragraphs

**Example:**

> Markets generate surplus. That's the core insight from Chapter 5.
>
> But surplus doesn't mean "extra stuff we don't need." It means the gap between what we must produce to survive and what we can actually produce when we specialize and trade. That gap—that breathing room—is what makes everything else possible.
>
> Without it, families scrape by. Safety systems go unfunded. Voluntary networks have no margin to operate. The whole ring starves.

**Notice:**
- Opening: 2 sentences, punchy
- Middle: Longer development, still under 6 lines
- Close: Short, stakes-driven

---

### Transition Strategies

**Avoid lazy transitions:**

❌ **Weak:** "In addition to that, there is also another point."  
❌ **Weak:** "Furthermore, one must consider..."  
❌ **Weak:** "Moreover, it should be noted that..."

**Use structural transitions:**

✅ **Strong:** "Here's where it gets strange."  
✅ **Strong:** "That's the theory. Now watch what happens in practice."  
✅ **Strong:** "Scale up from that moment, and you see a pattern."

**Use rhetorical questions:**

✅ "So what does this mean for your workplace?"  
✅ "Why does that matter?"  
✅ "Where does this show up in your life?"

**Use callback transitions:**

✅ "Remember the slug line from the Prologue? Same pattern."  
✅ "This is the nail-maker at scale."

---

## FORMATTING CONVENTIONS

### Capitalization

**The Ring:** Always capitalize when referring to the framework  
✅ "The Ring consists of four habitats."  
❌ "the ring consists of four habitats."

**Four Habitats:** Capitalize when naming the model  
✅ "The Four Habitats model"  
✅ "Family/Communism, Safety/Socialism, Markets/Capitalism, Friendship/Anarchy"

**Habitat names in text:** Lowercase unless starting sentence  
✅ "The market habitat generates surplus."  
✅ "Markets generate surplus."  
❌ "The Market Habitat generates surplus."

**Chapter references:**  
✅ "Chapter 5" (capitalize Chapter)  
✅ "Ch 5" (acceptable in tables/notes)  
❌ "chapter 5"

---

### Numbers

**Spell out one through nine:**  
✅ "three habitats"  
✅ "five minutes"

**Use numerals for 10+:**  
✅ "10 chapters"  
✅ "25 years"

**Exception - use numerals for:**
- Ages: "a 4-year-old"
- Percentages: "5% increase"
- Money: "$5 coffee"
- Times: "6 PM" or "6pm"
- Statistics: "10,000 nails"

**Large numbers:**  
✅ "10,000" (use comma)  
✅ "10 million" (spell million/billion/trillion)  
❌ "10000" (no comma)

---

### Punctuation

**Em dashes:** Use for emphasis or interruption (no spaces)  
✅ "The market—when it works—generates surplus."  
❌ "The market — when it works — generates surplus."

**En dashes:** Use for ranges  
✅ "pages 10–15"  
✅ "2020–2025"

**Ellipsis:** Three dots, use sparingly for trailing thought  
✅ "You start to see the pattern..."  
⚠️ **Overuse makes prose feel tentative**

**Semicolons:** Use to connect closely related independent clauses  
✅ "Markets generate surplus; families distribute it."  
⚠️ **Don't overuse; they can feel formal**

**Colons:** Use to introduce lists or explanations  
✅ "Here's what matters: the pattern you can actually use."

---

### Italics

**Use for emphasis (sparingly):**  
✅ "This is *not* about ideology."  
⚠️ "Overuse *weakens* the *effect* and looks *desperate*."

**Use for book/article titles:**  
✅ "*Blink* by Malcolm Gladwell"

**Never use for:**
- Entire sentences (feels like shouting)
- Multiple words in a row (unless quote)

---

### Bold

**Avoid in body text** (reserved for headings/subheadings)

**Exception:** Definitions in glossary/reference sections

---

### Quotation Marks

**Use for:**
- Direct dialogue: "Jump in," he said.
- Scare quotes (sparingly): The so-called "free market"
- Titles of articles: "The Future of Work"

**Punctuation inside quotes (American style):**  
✅ "This is the quote."  
✅ "Is this the quote?"  
❌ "This is the quote".

**Single quotes for quotes within quotes:**  
✅ He said, "The sign read 'Three to Pentagon.'"

---

### Lists

**Use bulleted lists when:**
- Order doesn't matter
- Items are roughly equal importance
- Scanning is valuable

**Use numbered lists when:**
- Order matters (steps, sequence)
- You'll reference items by number
- Ranking/priority implied

**List formatting:**
- Capitalize first word of each item
- Use parallel structure (all sentences or all fragments)
- Punctuate consistently (all periods or no periods)

**Example - fragments (no periods):**
- The Ring as framework
- Four distinct habitats
- Scale as organizing principle

**Example - sentences (with periods):**
- Markets generate surplus at scale.
- Safety systems protect impartially.
- Families distribute based on need.

---

## G+T-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### For Galvanizing (G) Readers

**Rally-Ready Language:**

✅ **Good:** "The Ring turns."  
✅ **Good:** "Obligation to excess."  
✅ **Good:** "From each according to ability, to each according to need."

**These are shareable because they're:**
- Short (1-5 words ideal)
- Memorable (rhythm, metaphor)
- Visual (can be drawn/gestured)
- Emotionally resonant

**Aha Moments:**

Structure insights for sudden clarity:

**Setup → Tension → Reveal:**

> "You've probably sat in meetings where someone says 'we're a family here.' Something feels off about that, right?
>
> Here's what's off: they're importing family logic into a market habitat. It's a category error. And now you can see it."

**The "Oh!" structure:**
- Name the experience (you've felt this)
- Create the question (why does it feel wrong?)
- Deliver the answer (here's the pattern)

---

### For Tenacity (T) Readers

**Clear Completion Milestones:**

❌ **Vague:** "We've talked about several habitats."  
✅ **Clear:** "You now understand all four habitats. The framework is complete."

❌ **Vague:** "Let's move on to the next section."  
✅ **Clear:** "Chapter 8 complete. You have the diagnostic tools. Next: what to do with them."

**Satisfying Synthesis:**

End sections/chapters with explicit wrap-up:

> "Let's pull this together.
>
> The Ring has four habitats: Family, Safety, Markets, Friendship. Each has a natural scale where it works. Try to run one habitat's logic everywhere, and things break.
>
> You now have the map. Next chapter: how to navigate with it."

**Action Pathways (Without Prescription):**

❌ **Too vague:** "Think about this."  
❌ **Too prescriptive:** "Do these five steps Monday morning."  
✅ **Just right:** "Ask yourself: which habitat am I in right now? Is the logic I'm using the right fit?"

---

## COMMON STYLE ERRORS

### Error 1: Academic Creep

**Symptoms:**
- Long, complex sentences
- Passive voice everywhere
- Third person only
- Hedging language

**Example:**
> "It has been observed that markets, when functioning optimally within appropriate regulatory frameworks, tend to exhibit characteristics of resource allocation that one might characterize as efficient, though this efficiency is contested within certain theoretical paradigms."

**Fix:**
> "Markets allocate resources efficiently. That's not ideology—it's observation. They fail sometimes, but when they work, they're remarkably good at matching supply to demand."

---

### Error 2: Jargon Overload

**Symptoms:**
- Technical terms without explanation
- Acronyms not spelled out
- Insider language

**Bad:**
> "The HOV regs incentivize carpooling via preferential lane access, creating a coordination prob that slugging solves through emergent equilibria."

**Good:**
> "HOV lane rules create an incentive: get three people in the car, use the fast lane. The slug line is how strangers coordinate to exploit that incentive."

**Rule:** If a term needs explanation, either explain it immediately or use simpler language.

---

### Error 3: Throat-Clearing

**Symptoms:**
- Long wind-up before the point
- Excessive setup
- Apologetic tone

**Bad:**
> "Before we proceed to examine the phenomenon of surplus generation, it's important to note that there are multiple perspectives on this issue, and while some scholars have argued that markets are optimal, others have raised concerns. With that caveat in mind, we can now turn to..."

**Good:**
> "Markets generate surplus. Here's how."

**Rule:** Cut the first paragraph. Often the real start is paragraph 2.

---

### Error 4: Weak Verbs

**Symptoms:**
- Forms of "to be" everywhere
- Nominalizations (turning verbs into nouns)
- Weak action words

**Bad:**
> "There is a tendency for markets to be productive of surplus in situations where there is specialization."

**Good:**
> "Markets generate surplus when people specialize."

**Bad verb → Strong verb:**
- "is productive of" → "produces" or "generates"
- "has a relationship to" → "connects to" or "affects"
- "makes a decision" → "decides"
- "provides assistance" → "helps"

---

### Error 5: Cliché Dependence

**Avoid overused phrases:**
- ❌ "At the end of the day"
- ❌ "Think outside the box"
- ❌ "Paradigm shift"
- ❌ "Low-hanging fruit"
- ❌ "Game changer"
- ❌ "Deep dive"

**Exception:** If you're subverting or playing with the cliché, go ahead.

**Example:**
> "Everyone talks about 'thinking outside the box.' But what if the box is actually four boxes, stacked together, and you've been standing inside the wrong one?"

---

### Error 6: Repetition Without Purpose

**Symptoms:**
- Same example used too many times
- Same phrasing repeated unconsciously
- Circular reasoning

**Bad:**
> "Markets generate surplus. The surplus that markets generate allows for investment. This investment creates more surplus. The surplus created by markets..."

**Good:**
> "Markets generate surplus. That surplus enables investment, which compounds over time."

**Rule:** Vary language unless you're deliberately creating rhythm or emphasis.

---

## VOICE EXAMPLES BY CONTEXT

### Opening Hooks (First 200 Words)

**Formula:** Concrete scene → stakes → tension

**Example:**
> By the time the green Acura pulled up beside me, I had already resigned myself to the slow way home.
>
> It was late enough that the evening light had given up and the office towers in Crystal City were doing most of the work. The wind coming down from the river had that particular D.C. talent for finding the gap between your collar and your neck. I was walking along the north edge of Crystal City toward the Pentagon bus stop, chewing on the mildly bitter taste of a missed ride home and an overlong workday.
>
> The HOV lanes on I-395 had just opened up to everyone. That magical time for commuters in northern Virginia where three people in a vehicle can magically transport you past the endless lines of traffic headed south was over. It was past the witching hour.

**Why this works:**
- Immediate scene (you're there)
- Sensory details (cold wind, tired walker)
- Stakes introduced (missed the ride, slow way home)
- Tension: "witching hour" promises something interesting

---

### Framework Explanations

**Formula:** Name → define → visualize → apply

**Example:**
> Call this the **Ring**.
>
> Not a line from left to right, but a loop. Four habitats where different coordination logics work: Family (intimate scale, from-each-to-each), Safety (collective essentials for everyone), Markets (surplus engine, individual value), Friendship (voluntary cooperation, emergent order).
>
> Draw it on a napkin: a circle with four segments. You're not choosing one to rule them all. You're asking: which habitat am I in? Which logic fits here?
>
> Watch what happens when you try to run family logic in a market, or market logic in a family. Things break. Not because the logic is bad, but because it's in the wrong place.

**Why this works:**
- Memorable name (The Ring)
- Clear visual (draw it)
- Practical application (ask yourself)
- Stakes (things break when wrong)

---

### Transitions Between Sections

**Formula:** Synthesize → pivot → preview

**Example:**
> So far, we've seen how family logic works at intimate scale. The kitchen table runs on from-each-to-each, and that's beautiful—when the circle stays small.
>
> But zoom out. What happens when you try to run an entire nation as one big family?
>
> The answer is in the next habitat: the commons of safety.

**Why this works:**
- Quick recap (so far)
- Question creates tension (what happens when)
- Clear preview (next habitat)

---

### Chapter Endings

**Formula:** Synthesis → stakes → cliffhanger question

**Example:**
> You now have the complete Ring. Four habitats, each with its natural scale. You can see them in your own life: the breakfast table, the commute, the workplace, the friend group.
>
> The question isn't whether you'll participate in all four. You already do.
>
> The question is: can you see when the wrong logic is operating in the wrong place? And if you can see it—what do you do about it?
>
> That's where we're going next.

**Why this works:**
- Clear completion (you now have)
- Raises stakes (wrong logic = problems)
- Pulls forward (what do you do about it?)

---

## TONE CALIBRATION BY CHAPTER TYPE

### Diagnostic Chapters (Ch 1-2)

**Tone:** Clear-eyed, slightly provocative, "here's what you've been missing"

**Voice characteristics:**
- Confident assertions
- Question existing assumptions
- Show familiar things in new light
- Build tension (the old map is broken)

**Example:**
> "We've been arguing about capitalism vs. socialism for 200 years. What if we've been asking the wrong question the whole time?"

---

### Framework Chapters (Ch 3-6)

**Tone:** Explanatory, systematic, conversational guide

**Voice characteristics:**
- Patient development
- Clear definitions
- Generous with examples
- Build scaffolding section by section

**Example:**
> "Let's be precise about what we mean by 'family logic.' It's not sentiment. It's a specific coordination pattern: from each according to ability, to each according to need. Now watch where this shows up."

---

### Synthesis Chapters (Ch 7-8)

**Tone:** Integrative, "aha," empowering

**Voice characteristics:**
- Pull threads together
- Show patterns across habitats
- Create recognition moments
- Enable reader agency

**Example:**
> "You've been navigating this your whole life. You just didn't have words for it. Now you do."

---

### Personal Operation Chapters (Ch 9-10)

**Tone:** Direct, honest, empowering without being prescriptive

**Voice characteristics:**
- Acknowledge hard tradeoffs
- Provide direction, not prescription
- Trust reader judgment
- Grounded hope

**Example:**
> "You can't fix everything. But you can steward your domain. Here's what that looks like."

---

### Vision Chapters (Epilogue + Appendix)

**Tone:** Hopeful, grounded in insight, energizing

**Voice characteristics:**
- Paint the upside scenario
- Ground in observable patterns
- Inspire without naiveté
- Call to action

**Example:**
> "This isn't fantasy. It's what becomes possible when enough people learn to see the pattern and operate well inside it."

---
