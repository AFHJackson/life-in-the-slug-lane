# Archive

This folder contains superseded reference documents preserved for historical context.

## Archived Files

| File | Replaced By | Date Archived |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `BOOK_DNA_WRITING_GUIDE.md` | `../BOOK_DNA_WRITING_GUIDE.md` (v2 with I→D→G voice architecture) | 2026-01-19 |

## Why Archived

These files were created during the initial G+T (Galvanizing+Tenacity) voice architecture phase. They were superseded by the I→D→G (Invention→Discernment→Galvanizing) voice pivot documented in DECISION_LOG.md as D008.

The I→D→G architecture better aligns with Joshua's Working Genius profile (Invention + Discernment) and shifts from prescriptive ("You should...") to diagnostic ("You'll recognize...") voice.

## Do Not Use

These files should not be used for current writing. Refer to the active files in `/reference/` instead.
