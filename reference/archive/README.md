## Why Archived

These files were created during the initial G+T (Galvanizing+Tenacity) voice architecture phase. They were superseded by the I→D→G (Invention→Discernment→Galvanizing) voice pivot documented in DECISION_LOG.md as D008.

**Key Changes in I→D→G Architecture:**
- **Target Audience:** G+T readers → I+D+G readers (those who will test AND spread)
- **Voice:** Prescriptive ("You should...") → Diagnostic ("You'll recognize...")
- **Structure:** Story/Framework/Application → Invention/Discernment/Galvanizing
- **Authority:** Assumed expertise in action → Acknowledged expertise in diagnosis

The I→D→G architecture better aligns with Joshua's Working Genius profile (Invention + Discernment) and creates more authentic, sustainable content.

## Do Not Use

These files should not be used for current writing. Refer to the active files in `/reference/` instead:
- `BOOK_DNA_WRITING_GUIDE.md` - Main voice and structure guide (I→D→G)
- `AGENT_PROMPT_SONNET_IDG.md` - Agent prompts for I→D→G writing
- `VOICE_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Checklist for validating I→D→G voice
- `WORKING_GENIUSES_IDG_RESEARCH.md` - Research on Working Geniuses → voice mapping
