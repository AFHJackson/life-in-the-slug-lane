# CHAPTER OUTLINE UPDATE PROTOCOL
## Converting Outlines from G+T to I→D→G Voice Architecture

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Purpose:** Systematic instructions for updating all chapter outlines  
**For:** Joshua + VS Code agents

---

## OVERVIEW

All 13 chapter outlines need updating from the old G+T prescriptive structure to the new I→D→G diagnostic structure. This protocol shows exactly how to make the conversion.

---

## THE STRUCTURAL SHIFT

### Old Structure (G+T)
```
PART 1: STORY (20%)
PART 2: FRAMEWORK (60%)
PART 3: APPLICATION (20%)
```

### New Structure (I→D→G)
```
PHASE 1: INVENTION OPENING (10-15%)
PHASE 2: DISCERNMENT MIDDLE (60-70%)
PHASE 3: GALVANIZING CLOSE (15-25%)
```

### Mapping the Change

| Old Section | New Phase | Key Change |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Story (20%) | I Opening (10-15%) | Story creates curiosity gap, previews novel framing |
| Framework (60%) | D Middle (60-70%) | Framework TESTED through examples, reader VERIFIES |
| Application (20%) | G Close (15-25%) | NOT "do this" but "recognize this, share this" |

---

## PHASE-BY-PHASE CONVERSION INSTRUCTIONS

### PHASE 1: INVENTION OPENING (10-15%)

**What stays:**
- Opening with concrete story (preserved)
- Sensory details and visceral hooks (preserved)

**What changes:**

| OLD | NEW |
|-----|-----|
| Story shows problem | Story creates CURIOSITY GAP |
| Story entry point | Story previews NOVEL FRAMING |
| "Here's what happened" | "Here's something you haven't seen this way" |

**Add to every Phase 1:**
- [ ] Curiosity gap statement
- [ ] Novel framing preview (what reader will discover)
- [ ] "Reader thinks: 'I've never seen it this way'"

**Voice markers for Phase 1:**
- "Here's what's actually happening..."
- "Consider a different map..."
- "There's a pattern here you haven't seen named..."

---

### PHASE 2: DISCERNMENT MIDDLE (60-70%)

**What stays:**
- Framework explanation (preserved)
- Concrete examples (preserved)
- Named concepts (preserved)

**What changes:**

| OLD | NEW |
|-----|-----|
| "Here's the framework" | "Let's TEST this framework" |
| Author explains | Reader VERIFIES |
| Examples illustrate | Examples INVITE RECOGNITION |
| "This is how it works" | "Notice how this appears in your experience" |

**Add to every Phase 2:**
- [ ] Verification invitation ("Think of a time when...")
- [ ] Pattern recognition across multiple domains
- [ ] Diagnostic questions (reader tests for themselves)
- [ ] Limits acknowledged ("The framework holds here, but...")
- [ ] "Reader thinks: 'Yes, I recognize this pattern'"

**Voice markers for Phase 2:**
- "Think of a time when..."
- "You've probably experienced..."
- "Notice how this appears in..."
- "Test this against your own..."
- "Where have you seen..."

**Convert old "explanation" sections to "verification" sections:**

OLD:
> "The Ring framework shows that political systems work at different scales..."

NEW:
> "The Ring suggests that political systems work at different scales. Test this: think of your last three political disagreements. Were they about values—or about which scale the other person was operating from?"

---

### PHASE 3: GALVANIZING CLOSE (15-25%)

**What stays:**
- Clear implications (preserved)
- Forward momentum (preserved)
- Rally-ready language (preserved)

**What changes:**

| OLD | NEW |
|-----|-----|
| "What this means for you: DO X" | "What this reveals: YOU'LL SEE X" |
| Implementation steps | Recognition patterns |
| "Apply this framework when..." | "You'll recognize this pattern when..." |
| "Complete this stage when..." | "You'll know you're here when..." |
| Action pathway | Sharing pathway |

**Add to every Phase 3:**
- [ ] Implications stated clearly ("This means...")
- [ ] Rally-ready summary (shareable in 30 seconds)
- [ ] Stakes made explicit (why this matters)
- [ ] Sharing equipment ("The next time someone... you'll recognize...")
- [ ] "Reader thinks: 'I know who I want to tell about this'"

**Voice markers for Phase 3:**
- "This means..."
- "The implication is..."
- "You can recognize this when..."
- "The next time someone argues about X..."
- "This equips you to..."

**Convert old "application" sections to "galvanizing" sections:**

OLD:
> "What this means for you: Apply this framework when navigating political discussions. Use the diagnostic questions to identify which habitat you're in. Complete a weekly review..."

NEW:
> "What this reveals: Stop choosing between ideologies. Start recognizing habitats. You'll know which one you're in by noticing: Who's involved? What's at stake? Can they exit? The next time someone argues about politics, you'll recognize something they don't see—they're applying different habitats to the same situation. You can name that now."

## VOICE NOTES UPDATE

### Old Voice Notes Section:
```markdown
## VOICE NOTES (G+T Calibration)

### What to DO:
- Rally-ready language

```

### New Voice Notes Section:
```markdown
## VOICE NOTES (I→D→G Calibration)

### Phase 1 (Invention) Voice:
- "Here's what's actually happening..."
- "There's a pattern here..."
- Create curiosity gap
- Novel framing preview

### Phase 2 (Discernment) Voice:

## QUICK CONVERSION TEMPLATE

For any chapter outline, make these changes:

```markdown
# CHAPTER X: [Title]
## Detailed Chapter Outline

**Target Length:** X words  
**Reader Milestone:** "I can RECOGNIZE/SEE..." (not "apply/do")  
**DNA Structure:** I Opening (10-15%) / D Middle (60-70%) / G Close (15-25%)

---

## PURPOSE

[Keep existing purpose, but reframe from "reader will be able to DO" to "reader will RECOGNIZE"]

---

## PHASE 1: INVENTION OPENING (10-15% of chapter)

### Opening Scene (Curiosity Gap)
[Existing story content]

**Curiosity gap:** [What question does this raise?]
**Novel framing preview:** [What will reader discover?]
**Reader thinks:** "I've never seen it this way"

---

## PHASE 2: DISCERNMENT MIDDLE (60-70% of chapter)

### Section 1: [Topic] — Verification
[Existing framework content]

**Verification invitation:**
- "Think of a time when..."
- "Notice how this appears in..."

### Section 2: [Topic] — Pattern Recognition
[Multiple examples across domains]

### Section 3: [Limits]
[Where framework holds, where it shows limits]

**Diagnostic questions:**
- [Question reader can use to test]
- [Question reader can use to verify]

**Reader thinks:** "Yes, I recognize this pattern"

---

## PHASE 3: GALVANIZING CLOSE (15-25% of chapter)

### Implications & Rally Summary

**This means:** [Clear statement of implications]

**Rally-ready summary:** [30-second shareable version]

**Stakes:** [Why this matters]

**Equip to share:** "The next time someone [X], you'll recognize [Y]..."

**Reader thinks:** "I know who I want to tell about this"
