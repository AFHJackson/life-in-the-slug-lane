# BOOK DNA WRITING GUIDE
**The I→D→G Voice Architecture**

**Date Created:** January 18, 2026  
**Date Renovated:** January 19, 2026  
**Purpose:** Translate I→D→G voice research into concrete writing instructions  
**For:** Joshua + VS Code agents (Opus 4.5 structure, Sonnet 4.5 content)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE VOICE PIVOT

**What Changed:** This guide originally targeted G+T (Galvanizing + Tenacity) readers with prescriptive "do this" voice. Research revealed a fundamental misalignment: Joshua has I+D (Invention + Discernment) geniuses, not Tenacity. Prescriptive advice felt inauthentic.

**The Solution:** I→D→G voice architecture.

| Old Approach (G+T Prescriptive) | New Approach (I→D→G Diagnostic) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| "Here's what you should do" | "Here's what you'll see" |
| Author prescribes actions | Author offers diagnostic tools |
| Tenacity implementation | Discernment verification |
| "Follow these steps" | "Test this in your context" |

**The Core Formula:**
> "Draws FROM Invention, Speaks IN Discernment, Speaks TO Galvanizing"

---

## THE I→D→G VOICE ARCHITECTURE

### What Each Component Does

| Component | Source/Mode/Target | Function |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Invention (I)** | Where authority comes from | Novel framework, recombined synthesis |
| **Discernment (D)** | How the voice sounds | Testing, verifying, inviting recognition |
| **Galvanizing (G)** | Who will spread it | Rally-ready language, clear stakes |

### The Flow

```
INVENTION creates novel framework (The Ring)
    ↓
DISCERNMENT verifies it works (reader tests)
    ↓
GALVANIZING spreads verified framework (rally-ready)
    ↓
(Tenacity implements—but book doesn't prescribe how)
```

### What This Means in Practice

**The book provides:** Frameworks, diagnostic tools, recognition patterns, shareable language

**The book does NOT provide:** Step-by-step implementation, prescriptive advice, "you should" instructions

**Reader journey:** "I never saw it this way" → "I recognize this pattern" → "I can share this"

---

## UNIVERSAL CHAPTER ARCHITECTURE

### The Three-Phase Structure

Every chapter flows through I→D→G in sequence:

**PHASE 1: INVENTION OPENING (10-15% of chapter)**
- Present novel insight or framework
- Create curiosity gap ("Here's something you haven't seen this way")
- Show the synthesis (recombining known elements)
- Establish what's at stake

**Voice markers:**
- "Here's what's actually happening..."
- "Consider a different map..."
- "What if we looked at it this way..."
- "The synthesis reveals..."

---

**PHASE 2: DISCERNMENT MIDDLE (60-70% of chapter)**
- Test framework through concrete examples
- Invite readers to verify against their own experience
- Show pattern across multiple domains (triangulation)
- Acknowledge limits and edge cases
- Provide diagnostic questions

**Voice markers:**
- "Notice how this appears in..."
- "Think of a time when..."
- "You've probably experienced..."
- "Test this against your own..."
- "The framework holds here, but shows limits when..."

---

**PHASE 3: GALVANIZING CLOSE (15-25% of chapter)**
- State implications clearly
- Provide rally-ready language
- Make stakes explicit
- Equip readers to share with others
- Connect to next chapter

**Voice markers:**
- "This means..."
- "The implication is..."
- "You can recognize this when..."
- "The next time someone argues..."
- "This equips you to..."

---

## THE THREE READER TYPES

### Who Your Book Serves (and How)

**Discernment (D) Readers:**
- Verify through pattern recognition
- Need recognizable examples from their own experience
- Want diagnostic questions, not prescriptive answers
- Trust authors who acknowledge limits
- *Book gives them:* Tools to test the framework themselves

**Galvanizing (G) Readers:**
- Spread verified frameworks
- Need rally-ready language and names
- Want clear stakes ("why this matters")
- Trust D readers' verification
- *Book gives them:* Shareable concepts and stories to retell

**Tenacity (T) Readers:**
- Implement in their contexts
- Need clear frameworks to work from
- Want completion milestones
- Trust that framework has been verified (D) and matters (G)
- *Book gives them:* Recognition of completion, NOT prescriptive steps

---

## LANGUAGE DNA: THE NEW VOICE

### What Changed

| Old (Prescriptive) | New (Diagnostic) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Apply this framework when..." | "You'll recognize this pattern when..." |
| "Use this diagnostic to identify..." | "Notice how this shows up in..." |
| "Here's what you should do" | "Here's what you'll see" |
| "Complete this stage when you..." | "You'll know you're here when..." |
| "Follow these steps" | "Test this in your context" |

---

### Voice Pattern 1: Invention (Authority)

**DO:**
- "Here's what's actually happening..."
- "The synthesis reveals..."
- "Notice the pattern that connects..."
- "Consider a different map..."

**DON'T:**
- "I believe that..." (personal opinion)
- "One might argue..." (academic hedging)
- "Studies suggest..." (borrowed authority)
- "The answer is definitively..." (false certainty)

**Authority Source:** Demonstrated mastery of terrain + novel synthesis. You claim The Ring, not the components (communism, socialism, etc. are known; the combination is yours).

---

### Voice Pattern 2: Discernment (Verification)

**DO:**
- "Think of a time when..."
- "You've probably experienced..."
- "Test this against your own..."
- "Notice how this appears..."
- "The framework holds here, but..."

**DON'T:**
- "This proves that..." (imposing conclusions)
- "You must therefore conclude..." (forcing agreement)
- "Obviously..." (assuming without verifying)
- "As I've shown..." (claiming proof)

**Verification Method:** Pattern recognition, not logical proof. Readers trust their instincts when you show them what they already know.

---

### Voice Pattern 3: Galvanizing (Spread)

**DO:**
- "This means..."
- "The implication is..."
- "You can recognize this when..."
- "The pattern reveals..."
- "This equips you to..."

**DON'T:**
- "You should do X..." (prescriptive)
- "The correct approach is..." (implementation)
- "Follow these steps..." (Tenacity territory)
- "It would appear that..." (academic distance)

**Spread Method:** Rally-ready language, clear stakes, stories that survive retelling.

---

### Rally-Ready Names (PRESERVED)

These remain essential—G readers need shareable language:

✅ **DO:**
- "The Ring" (visual, simple)
- "Four Habitats" (numbered, concrete)
- "Scale Errors" (diagnostic name)
- "Little Commune" (family = communism)
- "Safety Commons" (socialism at safety scale)
- "Surplus Engine" (markets generate excess)
- "Emergent Order" (friendship networks)
- "Obligation to Excess" (framework name)

❌ **DON'T:**
- "Circular relational model"
- "Polyarchic systems framework"
- "Scale-inappropriate applications"

**Test:** Can someone explain this at a dinner party in 30 seconds?

---

### Movement Language (PRESERVED with adjustment)

**DO:**
- "We already live in all four systems"
- "You've seen this pattern..."
- "This is how it works..."
- "Now you can see..."
- "Once you recognize this..."

**DON'T:**
- "You should do this..." (prescriptive)
- "The reader should observe..." (distant)
- "One could argue that..." (hedging)

**Adjustment:** "We" language for shared recognition, not rallying to action.

---

## CONCRETE VS. ABSTRACT: THE IRON RULE

### Concrete Before Abstract, Always

**Chapter flow:**
1. Concrete story (family dinner, hospital corridor)
2. Pattern extracted from story
3. Framework named
4. Verification across more examples
5. Rally-ready summary

**Never:**
- Framework → Definition → Examples

**Always:**
- Story → Pattern → Name → Verification → Summary

---

### Why This Works for D Readers

D readers verify through recognition, not logic. When your framework triggers "I've seen this!" they trust it.

**Wrong approach:** "The Ring framework demonstrates that political ideologies operate as scale-appropriate systems. Consider this example..."

**Right approach:** "Every morning, you wake up in a little commune. Someone makes coffee. Nobody sends invoices. This is your family. This is Tuesday. There's a name for what you just experienced..."

The reader discovers the framework rather than receives it.

---

## CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER DNA (UPDATED)

### PROLOGUE: The Hook

**Purpose:** Show we already live in the system (Slug Line example)  
**Phase Focus:** Heavy I, transitioning to D

**Structure:**

**Opening (500 words) — INVENTION:**
- Slug Line story (full, vivid, human)
- Morning commute, multiple systems touching
- Create curiosity gap: "There's a pattern here you haven't seen named"

**Development (1,000 words) — DISCERNMENT:**
- "Here's what you just experienced..."
- Name the four habitats operating simultaneously
- Invite recognition: "You've done this a thousand times"

**Close (500-1,000 words) — GALVANIZING:**
- "This isn't theory—you already live here"
- Preview: Better map exists (The Ring)
- Stakes: "The political discourse misses what you already know"

**I→D→G Check:**
- ✅ Novel framing? (I: You're already using all four systems)
- ✅ Reader verification? (D: Recognizable morning routine)
- ✅ Rally-ready? (G: "You're already a communist—at home")

**Voice Sample:**
> "Every morning, you wake up in a little commune. Someone makes coffee. Someone else starts breakfast. Nobody sends invoices. This is your family. This is Tuesday.
>
> Here's what you just experienced: communism. Not the ideology. Not the politics. The actual practice. You're already a communist. At home. And it works because it's at the right scale.
>
> There's a name for this pattern—and three others you touch before lunch. Once you see them, political arguments will never look the same."

---

### CHAPTER 1: One Size Fits None

**Purpose:** Introduce scale errors diagnostic + The Ring framework  
**Phase Focus:** Balanced I→D→G

**Structure:**

**INVENTION OPENING (1,200 words):**
- Concrete scale error story
  - Family trying to run like business (itemized chore billing)
  - OR business trying to run like family (mandatory feelings meetings)
- Curiosity gap: "Why does this feel so wrong?"
- Novel claim: "The map is broken, not the people"

**DISCERNMENT MIDDLE (4,000 words):**

*Section 1: The Broken Map*
- Current discourse: left vs. right line
- Invite verification: "Think of your last three political arguments"
- Pattern recognition: "They weren't about values—they were about scale"

*Section 2: The Ring Framework*
- Introduce The Ring visual concept
- Not competing teams, complementary systems
- Verification: "You've used all four this week"

*Section 3: Scale Errors Diagnostic*
- Define scale errors: "Applying the right system at wrong scale"
- Examples across domains (family, work, civic)
- Diagnostic questions: "What scale am I operating at?"

**GALVANIZING CLOSE (1,600 words):**
- "What this reveals..."
- Rally-ready summary: "Scale errors, not bad people"
- Stakes: "This is why we've been having the same arguments for decades"
- Equip to share: "The next time someone argues about politics, ask: which scale?"

**I→D→G Check:**
- ✅ Novel framework introduced? (The Ring)
- ✅ Reader tests against experience? (Three political arguments)
- ✅ Shareable diagnostic? ("What scale am I operating at?")

---

### CHAPTER 2: The Broken Line

**Purpose:** Deep dive on why left-right fails  
**Phase Focus:** D-heavy (testing the claim)

**Structure:**

**INVENTION OPENING (800 words):**
- Political argument story (from new content piece)
- Novel claim: "The line doesn't map to lived reality"

**DISCERNMENT MIDDLE (5,000 words):**
- History of left-right (where it came from)
- Where it works (certain electoral contexts)
- Where it fails (almost everywhere else)
- Verification: "Think of someone you disagree with politically. Do they actually hold all positions on 'their side'?"
- Pattern recognition: "People are inconsistent because the line is wrong, not because they're confused"

**GALVANIZING CLOSE (1,200 words):**
- "This means the real question isn't left or right—it's which scale"
- Rally-ready: "Stop asking 'which ideology?' Start asking 'which habitat?'"

---

### CHAPTERS 3-6: The Four Habitats

**Purpose:** Deep dive on each habitat  
**Phase Focus:** I→D→G for each, with D emphasis

**Pattern for Each:**

**INVENTION (10-15%):**
- Concrete story showing habitat in action
- Novel name and framing

**DISCERNMENT (60-70%):**
- How it works at correct scale
- Scale error examples (too small, too large)
- Verification: "Where have you seen this?"
- Limits and edge cases

**GALVANIZING (15-25%):**
- When to use this habitat
- Rally-ready summary
- Shareable insight

**Chapter 3 (Family/Communism):** The Little Commune  
**Chapter 4 (Safety/Socialism):** The Commons of Safety  
**Chapter 5 (Market/Capitalism):** The Surplus Engine  
**Chapter 6 (Friendship/Anarchy):** Emergent Order

---

### CHAPTERS 7-8: How Systems Touch

**Purpose:** Transition zones between habitats  
**Phase Focus:** D-heavy (nuanced verification)

**Key insight:** Real life happens at boundaries. This is where D readers earn the framework—it handles complexity, not just clean cases.

---

### CHAPTER 9: Obligation to Excess

**Purpose:** What to do with surplus  
**Phase Focus:** Balanced I→D→G

**Critical Note:** This chapter tests the "diagnostic not prescriptive" principle most directly. It's about what to recognize, not what to do.

**INVENTION:** Novel framework for thinking about excess (not "give it away" or "invest it")

**DISCERNMENT:** Test the framework against historical examples, reader's experience, edge cases

**GALVANIZING:** "You'll recognize the obligation when..." NOT "You should do X with your surplus"

---

### CHAPTER 10: Stewardship

**Purpose:** Recognition and navigation mastery  
**Phase Focus:** G-heavy (equipping spread)

**Key Shift:** By this point, D readers have verified the framework. Now equip G readers to share it.

- Navigator profiles (examples of people using The Ring well)
- Recognition markers ("You're here when...")
- Shareable stories and language
- NOT implementation steps

---

### EPILOGUE + APPENDIX

**Epilogue:** Vision of what changes when people see this  
**Appendix:** Reference tools (The Ring diagram, habitat summaries, diagnostic questions)

---

## VOICE EXAMPLES (UPDATED)

### Example 1: Chapter Opening (The Little Commune)

**❌ OLD (Prescriptive):**
> "To apply communism correctly in your family context, follow these principles: First, establish a 'from each according to ability' norm by discussing household contributions openly. Second, implement a 'to each according to need' distribution system..."

**✅ NEW (I→D→G):**
> "Every morning, you wake up in a little commune. Someone makes coffee. Someone else starts breakfast. If the toddler needs help, whoever's closest provides it. Nobody sends invoices. Nobody calculates fair exchange.
>
> There's a name for what you just experienced—and you've been doing it your whole life without knowing. It works at this scale. The question is why it stops working when you try to scale it up."

**Why it works:**
- I: Novel framing ("you're already a communist")
- D: Recognizable experience (morning routine)
- G: Shareable insight ("little commune")

---

### Example 2: Framework Explanation (Markets)

**❌ OLD (Academic/Prescriptive):**
> "Market mechanisms should be applied when coordinating strangers at scale. Use price signals to aggregate dispersed information. Avoid market logic in intimate contexts where it damages relationships."

**✅ NEW (I→D→G):**
> "Markets work when you need to coordinate strangers. You don't know the coffee farmer. She doesn't know you. But price does the work—connecting her Guatemalan hillside to your Monday morning without either of you needing to meet.
>
> At this scale (500+ people), markets are remarkable. They generate surplus, coordinate complexity, enable discovery your smartphone exists because markets work at scale.
>
> Think of a transaction that felt good—strangers cooperating through price. Now think of one that felt wrong—someone applying market logic where it didn't belong. The difference wasn't the mechanism. It was the scale."

**Why it works:**
- I: Novel framing ("Surplus Engine habitat")
- D: Verification questions (good/bad transaction)
- G: Rally-ready ("how strangers cooperate")

---

### Example 3: Chapter Closing (Navigation)

**❌ OLD (Prescriptive):**
> "To navigate effectively, ask these questions every Monday: Who's involved? What's at stake? Can they exit? Apply the appropriate habitat logic based on your answers. Complete a weekly review to track your navigation progress."

**✅ NEW (I→D→G):**
> "What this reveals: Stop choosing between ideologies. Start recognizing habitats.
>
> You'll know which one you're in by noticing: Who's involved? What's at stake? Can they exit? Those three questions show you the scale—and the scale shows you the tool.
>
> The next time someone argues about politics, you'll recognize something they don't see: they're not arguing about values. They're applying different habitats to the same situation. You can name that now. You can share what you see.
>
> The Ring isn't magic. It's just the right lens for what was always there."

**Why it works:**
- I: Novel diagnostic ("recognize habitats, not ideologies")
- D: Questions for self-verification
- G: Equips sharing ("name that now," "share what you see")

---

## WRITING SESSION PROTOCOL (UPDATED)

### Before Writing Each Chapter:

**Step 1: Review I→D→G Architecture**
- What novel insight does this chapter introduce? (I)
- How will readers verify it in their experience? (D)
- What rally-ready language does this chapter provide? (G)

**Step 2: Confirm Phase Balance**
- Invention Opening: 10-15%
- Discernment Middle: 60-70%
- Galvanizing Close: 15-25%

**Step 3: Gather Materials**
- Concrete stories for opening
- Verification examples for middle
- Rally-ready summaries for close
- Diagnostic questions throughout

---

### During Writing:

**Opening (Invention Phase):**
- Start with concrete story, not theory
- Create curiosity gap
- Preview novel framework
- Voice: "Here's what's actually happening..."

**Middle (Discernment Phase):**
- Test framework across multiple examples
- Invite reader verification
- Acknowledge limits
- Voice: "Notice how..." "Think of a time..." "You've probably..."

**Closing (Galvanizing Phase):**
- State implications clearly
- Provide rally-ready summary
- Equip readers to share
- Voice: "This means..." "You can recognize..." "The next time..."

---
