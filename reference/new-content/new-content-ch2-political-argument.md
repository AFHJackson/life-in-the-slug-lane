Sarah and Lauren had been walking together every morning for three years. Six a.m., rain or shine, accountability partners keeping each other honest about staying healthy. They'd solved most of the world's problems by now—or at least talked through all of them.

This morning started like the rest. Shoes laced. Coffee thermoses filled. The familiar route through the neighborhood, still quiet before the day really started.

"Did you see that story about the guy who got arrested trying to go back into the evacuation zone?" Sarah asked, breaking the comfortable silence.

Lauren nodded. "Yeah. Wild. He was trying to help a friend, right?"

"That's what got me," Sarah said, her pace quickening slightly the way it always did when something bothered her. "The guy's a trained professional. Used to be Coast Guard, I think. Certified in severe weather operations, hazardous rescue—the whole thing. His friend was stuck and couldn't get out before the storm hit. So he went back in to help."

"And got arrested before he even got there," Lauren finished.

"Right. And that just feels *wrong* to me." Sarah's frustration was evident. "This isn't some random guy with a hero complex. He knows what he's doing. He's probably more qualified than half the people officially running the operation. Why not just let him pass? If he wants to risk being in the worst of the storm, isn't that his business?"

Lauren was quiet for a few steps, which Sarah recognized as her friend working through something.

"I don't know," Lauren said finally. "I mean, I get it. Guy's trying to help his friend. He's got the training. But..."

"But what?"

"But the emergency response teams don't know him. They're already stretched thin, trying to coordinate evacuations, rescues, keeping roads clear. They don't have time to stop and verify everyone's credentials. And if something goes wrong with him, they're the ones who'll have to divert resources to bail him out."

Sarah felt the familiar tightness of a conversation that was about to go somewhere uncomfortable. "So you think he should've just let his friend die?"

"That's not what I'm saying." Lauren's voice had that careful edge that meant she was trying not to start a fight. "I'm saying the evacuation order exists for a reason. You can't have everyone deciding for themselves whether they're the exception."

"But he *is* the exception," Sarah insisted. "That's the whole point. He's not some random civilian."

"How are the emergency teams supposed to know that? They're dealing with a hurricane. They can't stop to interview every person who thinks they've got a good reason to be there."

Sarah's jaw tightened. "So we just... what? Prioritize bureaucratic order over actually helping people?"

Lauren stopped walking. "That's not fair, Sarah. I'm not saying don't help people. I'm saying when you've got limited resources and a disaster situation, you need *some* kind of coordination. Otherwise it's chaos."

They walked in silence for half a block. Sarah could feel the weight of the unspoken argument. This was the kind of conversation that felt like it should have a clear answer, but somehow never did.

"What about looters?" Lauren asked quietly. "If you let him through because he says he's got training and a good reason, how do you stop the people who just want to get back in and clean out abandoned houses?"

"I guess... I don't know. Make him sign something? He's on his own, not the government's problem?"

"And if he gets hurt and it goes viral? 'Government let civilian die in storm zone.' You know someone's going to sue. Or call for someone to be fired."

Sarah rubbed her forehead. "So the alternative is better? 'Government prevented trained rescuer from saving friend's life.' That's going to go over great too."

"I'm not saying it's better. I'm saying there's no good answer."

"There has to be."

"Does there?" Lauren's voice was gentler now. Not combative. Just... tired. "Maybe some situations just suck all the way around."

Sarah wanted to argue. She wanted there to be a clear line between right and wrong here, between the people who cared about helping and the people who just wanted to follow rules. But she could feel the conversation circling, the same points coming back around from different angles.

They walked the rest of their route in a silence that felt heavier than usual. Both of them thinking about the man who'd tried to help his friend. Both of them thinking about the emergency teams who'd arrested him. Both of them thinking about the friend who might or might not have needed help.

Neither of them convinced the other.

Neither of them sure they were right.

Both of them certain the other couldn't possibly be.

When they got back to where their cars were parked, Lauren gave Sarah's shoulder a squeeze. "Same time tomorrow?"

"Yeah," Sarah said. "Same time tomorrow."

They would solve it eventually. Or at least talk it through. That's what three years of walking together had taught them. Every problem had a solution if you just kept walking long enough.

But on this one, neither of them could see it yet.
