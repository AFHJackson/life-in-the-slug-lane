Marcus knocked over his water glass reaching for the breadbasket.

"Got it," Kenji said, already moving with the dish towel he'd learned to keep tucked in his back pocket at mealtimes. The water spread across the table in that slow-motion way that always seemed to happen right when everyone had just sat down.

Kai erupted in laughter. "Marcus, you're supposed to *drink* the water, not—"

"Kai," Jada said, her voice carrying that mom-warning tone even though she was trying not to smile. She had maybe four minutes before Naomi decided being held by Grandma Diane wasn't as good as being fed by Mom, and she was determined to get actual food in her mouth during those four minutes.

"I got it, I got it," Marcus muttered, face red, trying to help mop up the water with his napkin, which immediately disintegrated into wet shreds.

"Use this, baby," Diane said, somehow producing a dry kitchen towel from the diaper bag next to her chair while still holding Naomi against her shoulder, patting the baby's back in that rhythmic way that kept her calm. How Diane managed to be the most useful person in the room while sitting perfectly still and doing nothing but hold a four-month-old was a mystery Jada had stopped trying to solve.

Kenji squeezed water out of the towel into Marcus's empty glass—because why walk to the sink when you're in the middle of serving dinner—and slid a new plate in front of their older son. "There you go, bud. Fresh start. So how was school?"

"Fine."

"Fine? That's it?" Kenji loaded Marcus's plate with rice, chicken, and vegetables in portions that looked enormous to Jada but that Marcus would somehow demolish. "Come on, give me something. What'd you do in science?"

"Stuff."

Kai snorted. "He got in trouble for making armpit farts during silent reading."

"I did *not*—it was *one* time and it was an *accident*—"

"An accident?" Kai's voice went up about three octaves. "You literally—"

"Boys," Jada said around a mouthful of chicken. God, when had she last eaten something that wasn't cold or consumed while standing at the kitchen counter? She caught Kenji's eye across the table. He was trying to gauge if she was about to lose it. She wasn't. This was actually the best seventeen minutes of her day so far.

Kenji served Kai's plate next—slightly smaller portions, which Kai would complain about even though he never finished anyway—and kept going with the interrogation. "Okay, so silent reading. Were you actually reading?"

"Yeah."

"What book?"

Kai thought about this with an intensity usually reserved for math tests. "The one with the... dog?"

"Very specific, Kai. Super helpful." But Kenji was grinning. Jada loved that about him—he could never stay stern. The boys knew it too, which was probably a problem, but right now she was just grateful the house was full of laughter and the sound of her mother's voice humming softly to Naomi.

"Here, Mama." Kenji slid a full plate in front of Diane. Heaping portions, the way she used to serve him when they were first married and he was still too polite to say it was too much food.

"Baby, I don't need all this—"

"Yes you do. You've been holding her for twenty minutes. Eat."

Diane smiled but didn't argue. Just shifted Naomi slightly and started eating one-handed, which she'd been doing since Jada was a baby and apparently hadn't forgotten how.

Jada watched her mother—silver hair pulled back, reading glasses she'd forgotten to take off after helping Marcus with homework, the soft pink cardigan she always wore in the evenings. Diane had been living with them for eight months now, since Dad passed. Jada kept waiting for her to bring up getting her own place, maybe a small apartment nearby. But Diane never mentioned it. And honestly, Jada didn't want her to.

Not just because of the help—though God, the help—but because when she watched her mother with the boys, with Naomi, with Kenji... this was what it was supposed to look like. This was what her dad would have wanted. Not Diane alone in some apartment, visiting on weekends. This. The noise and the spills and Marcus's armpit farts and Kai's nonsense answers about school.

"How's my baby doing?" Diane asked, not looking up from her plate but somehow knowing Jada was watching her.

"I'm good, Mama."

"No, I mean *my* baby." Diane nodded toward Naomi, who had started making those small grunting noises that meant she was working up to a cry. "She getting hungry?"

"Probably. I can—"

"Finish your food. She's fine for another minute." Diane stood, still balancing her plate, and started that automatic walk-bounce-pat combination that every grandmother seemed to have installed at the factory. Naomi immediately quieted.

Kenji caught Jada's eye again. *Your mom is magic.*

*I know.*

"Dad," Marcus said suddenly, "can I have more chicken?"

"You haven't finished what's on your plate."

"But I'm really hungry."

"Then eat what you have."

"But what if I'm still hungry after?"

Kenji sighed the sigh of a man who'd had this exact conversation every night for nine years. "Then you can have more chicken, Marcus."

"Can I have more *now* so I don't have to get up later?"

"No, because you'll take it and not eat it and then we'll have this same fight tomorrow about wasted food."

"I won't waste it!"

"Marcus." Jada's one-word shutdown. The boy started eating.

Kai, sensing an opportunity in the chaos, made his move. "Can *I* have more chicken?"

"You haven't touched your chicken."

"Yes I have! Look!" Kai held up his fork with one small piece speared on it. "See? Touching it right now."

Diane laughed from over by the window, that sound that made Jada think of Sunday mornings when she was little, her dad making pancakes, her mom's laugh floating through the house like music.

*Her mom, who wasn't charging rent.*

*Her mom, who'd been doing laundry without being asked.*

*Her mom, who'd somehow already figured out which nights Kenji was too tired to cook and would have dinner started before he got home.*

*Her mom, who held Naomi during dinner so Jada could eat.*

*Her mom, who was giving everything and asking for nothing.*

And Kenji—working full days, coming home to chaos, serving everyone else first, keeping the boys entertained, checking if Jada was okay every five minutes even though she'd told him a hundred times she was fine.

And the boys, eating everything in sight without ever once asking who paid for it or whose paycheck this came from. Just eating. Just growing. Just being kids at dinner.

Nobody was tracking any of this. Nobody was counting.

If Jada tried to calculate it—her mother's contributions, Kenji's labor, her own invisible work, the boys' consumption—the accounting books would be gloriously uneven. Marcus was taking way more than he gave. Naomi was taking *everything* and giving back mostly crying and diapers. Diane was giving constantly and taking almost nothing. Kenji was working and serving and entertaining and asking for nothing in return except maybe four hours of sleep in a row, which he wasn't getting.

And it was perfect.

It was perfect *because* nobody was counting.

"Okay," Jada said, pushing back from the table. "Give me my baby."

Diane brought Naomi over, kissing the top of the baby's head before handing her to Jada. "She's all yours. I'll get these dishes started."

"Mama, you don't have to—"

But Diane was already collecting plates, and Kenji was already up helping, and Marcus was asking if there was dessert (there wasn't), and Kai was asking if he could be excused (he couldn't, not until he ate at least three more bites), and Naomi was rooting around looking for milk, and the kitchen smelled like ginger and soy sauce and home.

This was Tuesday.

This was just dinner.

This was all of them giving what they could because of who they were—dad, mom, grandma, sons, daughter—not because anyone was keeping score.

And if you'd told them they were living out Marx's most famous sentence, they'd have looked at you like you were crazy.

But they were. Every night. Right there at that table.

*From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.*

They didn't call it communism.

They called it family.
