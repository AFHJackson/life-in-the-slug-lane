This association is furthered in the way the two habitats serve to solve the individual's problem of how an individual person could possibly interact justly at a complexity scale of popultation.  In both a marketplace and a municiplatity, really knowing all other individuals is simply not possible.  Where the marketplace depends on the 'invisble hand' of the market and the municipality depends on the abstraction of all individuals to 'human, to define the wants and needs of the others at a population scale, the indentity of the individual engaging the polutionation has been formed in the individual-to-individual habitats and becomes the guiding force.
